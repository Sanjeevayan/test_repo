i wont go here again the service was very slow and some of our food came cold  i had the shrimp from the appetizer menu and didnt feel good the rest of the night  this is definitely a miss
i stopped at this place because they had a sign out front that said free free free  can of soda and a bag of chips with sandwich or platter purchase  ok  it got me  so i went in  ordered a sandwich  grabbed a small bag of chips off the shelf and a can of soda and went to the register  to my surprise  it rung up at 11  when i questioned the man he said the chips i had didnt count  i needed the secret crappy chips they had hidden behind the counter  ok  so then my total was still 880  oh  only the chips or the soda is included  not both  and btw  it clearly says and a bag of chips see photos  so i gave the chips back and said i just wanted the soda so he mumbled a new price i couldnt really hear and ran my card  i had to ask for the receipt and just shoved it in my pocket  so i get home and realize the receipt is for 880  really  shouldve taken those stupid chips  what a ripoff  and i check the reviews to find out that ripping people off is a normal business practice of theirs  only those reviews are conveniently filtered  did you know if you scroll down the bottom where it says 1 through x of x that there is a link to see reviews that have been filtered out  if you didnt you probably still dont  because i imagine my review will be filtered too  update i went back to the establishment to complain and they claimed the extra charge was not for the soda andor chips  but rather because i got my sandwich on a roll  like the other reviewer  the guy behind the counter offered it to me on a roll and i said fine i was never informed of the extra charge  but instead of apologizing for the confusion he offered to let me take the advertised bag of chips
not sure what its like now  but was my favorite as an undergrad pizza was the best on campus salads were enormous   but honestly everyone should try to avoid it because they still dont use normal plats and silverware everything is disposable and for a school that takes a lot of pride in its greenness  thats pretty ridiculous
wings etc recently opened up down the road from where i live  which made me excited to have a sports bar where i could catch a game with some hopefully tasty food and cold beer its a chain regional to the midwest and seems to have somewhat of a following  so what the heck  i went with coworkers on two occasions one  which i will briefly touch on  was to conquer their wall of flame challenge which involved eating 16 crazy hot wings with no food or drink success at the sacrifice of all taste for the next day worth it well  i did get a free tshirt  back to wings having worked in restaurants for a decent part of my life  i am critical when it comes to service  im not a jerk by any means  and i understand the concept of being busy  but there should be a good line of communication between staff and customer wings etc does not have this we waited 10 minutes for our waitress  15 minutes for our drinks  30 minutes for our food  and then 20 minutes more for her to bring us the check and then run our credit cards thats just not acceptable and the second time i went back  the service was just as bad not friendly  and way too long  as for the food  its ok the boneless wings are cooked to death so you get crusty nuggets and the traditional wings are a bit big because they are jumbo and have a large skin pocket on them that does not cook very well  leaving you with a flabby  fatty wing to eat the sauces are ok  much thicker than any other wing place i have been to  and most seem to have a tomato base so the sauce does not really stick to the wing  meaning the wings are a bit bland the fries they make are very tasty  but thats pretty much all i found enjoyable about the experience so sadly i will have to travel further down the road if i want chicken wings or a football game  because this place is just not working out
if you want box cupcakes with store bought frosting at 250 a pop served with a crap attitude this place is for you   if you like let downs for a sweet treat this place is also for you   if you want a great cupcake experience like magnolia or something similar to nyc i would recommend searching elsewhere  cause you aint gonna find it here  my friends and i sampled 6 cupcakes and are happy to report we will increase our savings rate by not spending money on cupcakes in princeton  if youre the owner reading this review stop skimping on your product and make great quality cupcakes with love and flavor and employee someone that cares to describe whats behind the counter to the customer  first time in my life ive thrown away cupcakes
the food is actually pretty good and cheap   but because your service sucked so much ass tonight that i left  im bringing you down  le petit cheval   im the antientitlted american  and so for me to call out a place for bad service means there was some baaaad service baaaaad
for 8 bucks i got a sub par philly steak the bread was weird with its soft texture the meat was not all that good i had to slather hot sauce over it to make it bearable plus they told me i needed a coupon to get the deal there were advertising i do not think this place will last long but i may come back to try their jersey combo sandwich should the right situation come along
worst chipotle i have ever been to horrible service  very stingy workers  lard in my barbacoa  and to top it off  two of the top avocado seeds in my guac  go down kirby to main for the best chipotle under the sun  dont waste ur time  money here
so overrated all the hype  to which the place doesnt really live up to  first of all  what kind of burger place serve their customer their burgers with soggybuns opening the wrapper within 5 min of leaving the shop  we came across with  quite mediocre  soggy  and allaround disappointing burgers  i didnt really think there was anything outstanding about it ok yes  its maybe just slightly better than mcdonalds but wow  the difference is really paperthin    my son  reading this review  exclaimed what i think mcdonalds better  he couldnt finish the burger  this is a telltale sign of failure but i give it that fg is ever so slightly healthier than mcdonald   i also should mention that  whoever packed our bag  put the fries in a cup upside down  well  thank you  a nice touch  i think glenwood pines restaurant by taughannock falls serves a burger x15 times better than this one  and the price is not all that different  as i remember   and potatoes from idaho cmon  that sounds so fresh  local and sustainable  that this sound enticing to most people with poisoned mind  is the problem of the  world today we need to all think about   the cashier and the guy who handed me the burger were young parttimers  just like mcdonalds  i find them sort of rude  especially the guy  when he refused to take my receipt since i didnt need it any more i also wonder if the same guy put our fries upside down  thumbs down all the way
it should be called vegan galaxy im vegetarian and was so wanting this place to be goodbut it just was terrible the kendall burger sounded good but the onion rings were tasteless  the patty fell apart and the dressed arugula and shredded cabbage were sorry sides an order of fries cant be wrong  can it oh no  tasteless strikes again they seem to think that you can throw a dusting of an herb on top of anything and call it done it left me wondering if they had sucked the flavor out of the fries and maybe injected it into some other dish all desserts we ordered were inedible i will never ever go here again 
this review is for the restaurant some friends and i were meeting on a saturday night near the holidays and sat a big table weve done this in the past and it was fine  we all ordered drinks and appetizers to share  the waitress was nice when she took our order  the place wasnt even packed and we got our drinks and food pretty quickly    about 5 minutes after we got our food  the waitress comes over to tell us that we need to move from our table because we sat a table that was reserved for a private party there was nothing on the table to indicate this the table behind us and the tables against the wall had reserved signs on them but not our table we were pretty much in shock at being told that we had to move if you want us to move  then you should relocate us or help us find somewhere to move to dont just expect me to move because you screwed up and forgot to put a reserved sign on the table where i have been sitting for nearly an hour now i dont expect four star service at a place like this but if youre going to screw up  dont expect me to fix your mistake for you that is why you get paid we asked for a manager we never got to speak to one a little bit of attention to paying customers would be nice from the management we never had anyone come to our table and take our check we all had to walk to the bar to pay our bill  the complete lack of professionalism here is astounding  it was a nice experience until they realized they needed another table for their reservation but this experience was a deal breaker for me slo brews management and staff need to get it together because my friends and i will never return because of how rudely we were treated
because im from la  i thought pho might be a safe choice for having asian food here at austin it turned out i was wrong i didnt try other dishes here  but their pho was absolutely the worst that i have ever had the soup was so salty  the beef was also scarce  the rice noodle was just overbroiled
the only reason for me to step in was its only several blocks away from my school their pho 1 is mediocre with only a few pieces of meat rare beef was okay  welldone beef was like plastic meat ball was like rubber ball chopped into three pieces even in pasadena  its been overpriced 10 for a mediumsized pho come on  this is sgv you can easily find much better pho with much more meat under 6 or 7 id rather drive to alhambra or san gabriel next time
very expensive  taste is not that good  we were really disappointed moreover serving size is small  not many veg options i surely will not go here again
poor service  worse coffee  we ordered 2 cappuccinos they were made with preground espresso taken out of an unsealed plastic bin   the proportions were way off and i could not even finish it  they claim to to roast their own beans which makes me wonder why they dont put the effort into preparing the coffee properly  there is no excuse for serving espresso made with preground beans  if you dont want to buy a decent grinder for espresso just dont serve it  i didnt have the drip coffee but i witnessed the cashier pouring two old pots together
overpriced cupcakes and long lines the quality is ok but nothing so extraordinary to stand in line for half an hour i wish they would put  less frosting on them   it really overpowers the taste of the cake used
blech the dark chocolate frosting was way too sugary  and the cake was dry and crumbly and lacked much in the way of chocolate flavor also  you have to order at the counter and wait to be called wtf  even if all youre having is a cupcake on a plate they even waste an order slip on single items their cupcakes cost 350 tax not included  so i paid more than karas would have cost me for an inferior product  the counter people seemed very friendly  but the cupcake was lackluster enough that i wont be back
if i remember correctly  the way you make kirks fries is as following  1 open your bag of frozen fries 2 dunk them in oil 3 serve  im waiting for my heart attack  note theyre not all too welcoming towards high schoolers anymore
straight off  know this when you see my rating  hair in my crossaint  how nasty is that maybe theyre trying to show its actually handmade i stared at the hair and said  okay  im not eating another bite  their buffarello mozzerella salads are good and hairless but it does seem a little pricey 7 when compared to the regular salads 5 the paninis are not very filling  though  heres a tip as if you can switch your tart what is that one that looks like a brain with one of the mini chocolate squares to the left of the register now  those are goooood
im not sure if this place deserves one stari went with my husband tonight to get some dinner  we ordered two specialty rolls  chirashi  and tamago sushi  the rolls were tasteless  the fish was tasteless tuna was especially fishy in a bad way  and the portion sizes were very small the tamago was not what we expected at all  for the amount of money we spenti couldve gotten much better at sakura express definitely not worthy of a return visit
i have not been impressed with this place even though i tried to give them a few chances  i dined in the restaurant once and the place was so cramped that the next table was only a few inches from mine  i could hear the conversation of the people that were two tables away  their menu said that my combo came with a salad but they never brought one to me claiming their menu was misprinted  i felt since they advertised it they should of comped the salad or mentioned it before i ordered  the second time we went there i ordered an adana wrap to go and it was so small for something that was 8  there one tiny piece of meat in the wrap  the third time i ordered delivery from there and and they overcharged me by more than five dollars  i didnt realize because i did not have the menu with the prices until i looked at the one stapled to our food  i was not happy about that
blakes is full of ampted 1924 yearold berkeley students getting tanked in order to prep for banging one of the many slutty rotten eggs that hang there luckily  some ok bands are seen into the basement from time to time but as the night progresses  the slime from the main floor and upstairs inevitably oozes not only into the basement but out onto telegraph ave here  overtestosteroned boys cranky from not scoring poon start fights with eachother  barf  and eventually drive home drunk awesome
cheap cheap cheap with the toppings ive been here once  right when it opened they barely filled the cup with yogurt  and the middle was hollow thanks for the single teaspoon sprinkling of granola  and carefully laid out strawberries wtf
hohoho  its almost indulgently fun to write reviews about restaurants like this  almost as fun as spotting the typos on the menu  nothing was good about this place  not one thing  i got the spicy beef  with a side of brown rice that evidently i have to pay extra for  thanks for letting me know after the fact  as i could have predicted  the bowl was 70 onion and pepper  and the beef was like paper  no seriously  havent you ever tried to eat a tiny piece of paper  thats what the beef was like  chewy and flavorless  not to mention indigestible  the omnipotent clovebasil flavor was overwhelming  and the only source of spiciness was the serrano peppers  i could have just brought my own serranos  what a cheap way to create heat  however  it certainly wasnt cheap economically  considering i had to add a gratuity tip because i was with a large group of people  nothing irks me more than being forced to tip services that do an abysmal job    lastly  a random thought  on one wall they have a certificate hanging up that thanks berkeley thai house for a donation to the child abuse foundation  um  shouldnt that organization be called the antichild abuse foundation  yikes
multidimensional failure  i wish i could review the actual cupcakes but am instead forced to review why i couldnt have there cupcakes  it was after the super bowl and i wanted to surpise my girlfriend with a cupcake as she was studying for a final the next day someone at the watching party mentioned giving trophy a shot as i was thinking of just heading over to cupcake royale as i was already in capitol hill i whip out my phone and hop on there website to check how late they are open on sundays and the site clearly states 9pm so i figure i am good to go  upon arriving at the university village i cant find the place and it is getting close to 9pm  i double check the website on my phone for a hint of what part of the massive complex they are located but have no luck eventually i google trophy cupcake university village and find a couple articles about the opening of the store which mentioned something about a frog fountain and a play ground which at least gives me something to look for i park and go check a map and i see fountain icons and what i can only figure is a playground icon on the map so i walk in that direction only to find a pitch black store  so not only did their website lie to me you cant even see the store from the road so im not sure how the hell they expect you to find it  upon getting home and checking the yelp page i see that yelp has them closing at 6pm on sundays and when i go to there website using my own computer it also says 6pm now i think i am going to crazy so i double check with my phone and it still says 9pm  flash is evil for the love of god stop using flash  on my phone when i click on locations i am directed to the following page which only loads the text and not the flash on my cell phone httpwwwtrophycupcakescominfohtm  if you view source on that page youll see where it says 9pm is the close on sundays which is exactly what i saw i wouldnt have cared if they closed at 6pm on sunday if there webpage had just told me that and i hadnt wasted my time trying to hunt the place down
first  they dont take reservations so we get there at 545pm  and there is a 2 hr wait  and the 2 very small bars that they  do have are full but it is first come first serve so we take our chance at the bar   we order a drink and strategically stand behind a couple that were finishing their dinner at the bar  while they were finishing another couple had just walked into the bar area and were obviously big money and went straight to the bartenders to talk to them  the couple standing in front of us were about to leave and looked right at us and offered us their seats  we sit down  and the bartender walks over to us and tells us sorry  but these seats have been promised to this couple  the one that had just walked in   so you dont take reservations  but you promise bar seats to people   we could not believe it and decided to walk right out thank goodness hemenways  is right down the street because it had a much better bar area and was not filled with stuck up people as in al fornos
take it for what it is  i suppose  cuatros has a big patio  its great for groups  you can watch all the soccer you want there  the food is terrible  and i am consistently disappointed with the service  last time i went  we waited two seconds to get our table  and about an hour and fifteen minutes for the waitress to take our order  i understand that we were a big group  but if you want to provide service to big groups  hire a bigger wait staff  service that slow really takes away from the dining experience  its hard to enjoy your food when youre angry about the slow service    what upsets me most is the included gratuity  if youre going to hire an insufficient wait staff for your giant restaurant  its really unfair to demand a tip like that  we were a large group  and our check was not split up i think waiters and waitresses who cantdont do this are dumb and lazy  evidently we shorted the waitress about 12 on a few hundred dollar tab  which always seems to happen even if everyone swears that they paid in full  she came out and told us that we shorted her  take the hit  you were a terrible waitress  you dont deserve a tip that high  so when we accidentally come up short  have some pride and class  and go home with 12 dollars less that night  instead of whining to the table about it  at least one of their waitresses is a whiny baby who is in over her head in the restaurant business  i always groan when people want to go to dinner here with a group  next time  i wont be ordering food  you brought it on yourself  cuatros
this place is overpriced for subpar food  the waitstaff is too stoned to take less than a half hour on any order  people rave about the queso here  but i dont know why  its too thick and salty  and the chips dont help  i havent had pancakes here  and i hear theyre worth the trip  but nothing gets me excited to eat here  i say can it and find a taco stand on the street
bunch of buttholes who work hereincluding the manager who probably isnt even certified to manage anything  basically  a couple months ago i ordered a pizza via phone  employee tells me that service is backed up and that i would have to wait at least an hourokay fine with me except i never received my pizza after an hour and 15 minutes of patiently waiting  i call back and the employee informs me that they have no record whatsoever of my order i demand to speak to manager  and all she does apologizes rudely might i add and hangs up and thats it not even an offer to makeup  etc will never  ever order here again
this place is dirty  just  bleh  out of all the places on the drag  this place is one of the nastiest  i dont know why all my friends like going to this place  i tried the pad thai yeah  yeah  i know  stereotypical customer getting pad thai  but it was nasty  i feel like i would be able to make better pad thai on my own and im a terrible  terrible cook  and then the customer service  ack  that was terrible  i understand that they can get busy and all but this was just down right terrible  if i return to madam mams it will not be my choice
yeah madam mams is in close vicinity to college students attending ut  yeah its thai food on the drag yeahhhthats about it for me  walking inside  the place smells horrendous  like bathrooms no joke and looks unclean  prices are high and portions are tiny  the food itself is not pleasing at allvery americanized and not fresh  the pad thai had sauce that lookedtasted like ketchup  the mangosticky rice dessert is sour  the consistency of the rice was just not right  and there was barely any coconut milk on it  i have ate there numerous times unfortunatelyi had no choice due to friends pick  and i swear i had tummy aches after each visit for the rest of the day    if you want thai food  go down the drag to thai kitchen
well  what can i say about food at this place   plain  small  expensive just like all the chinese food in the area  this place is no exception the food i got here was exactly what i kinda expected from places this close to campus  maybe im bitching because ive been spoiled in houston  where you can still get a giant plate of lunch special in chinatown for 4 bucks  or have two giant meals with enough leftovers for four more for 305 tip oh well  these college kids seems to be content with this but to me the standards are set long ago and in a land far far 160 miles away   the chinese food here just doesnt hold up maybe one day some dashing young houstonian with a kind heart and an entrepreneur sense will liberate your schooltormented souls with cheap and delicious food and not be tempted to overcharge your butt for profit until that day  keep shelling out 8 or more for a plate and think youre getting a great deal here id rather save my chinese appetite and my money for gas to houston better quality  quantity  and pricing
hello can you bus the tables hello we came to double daves on a saturday night  one other couple just finished up and was leaving we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 1520 minutes waiting on some out of town family to arrive most of the tables were filled with leftover food and dirty dishes it was gross the restaurant was not busy at all  so its not as if the staff was overwhelmed or anything we had to find a table off in a darkened corner because of this blech  sadly  we did eat there  though not very much because we had lost our appetites and the food is not that great   and when we left absolutely none of the tables had been cleared another family that was arriving was in the same boat they sat right next to us because there was no where else to sit wth really  what reason do i have to return
this is not chinese food  a friend and i came here one time  honestly  because we heard it was bad and we wanted to see for ourselves just how bad bad was  boy ill tell ya  bad is about as bad as it gets the foodisjust plain wrong  like above  it is not chinese food  and why anyone would call it chinese food is completely beyond me  not to mention  i had to pay ten dollars for a plate ofdisgustingness  angry does not even describe how i was feeling  i almost didnt pay for my meal and i certainly did not tip  because that was just a completely waste of my time and money
boba loca used to quote jesus christ on their plastic cups quite frankly  that creeped me out i just want to drink my fucking boba  man can you leave the lord out of it  please   my korean roommate loved this place  incidentally not quite as much as he loved jesus  though
wow  talk about terrible service  today i ordered ahmos to be delivered to me at work the delivery driver called before he got here and asked me to meet him on the street  instead of the usual coming into where i am when i did meet him  he didnt have my credit card slip to sign  and insisted that i pay in cash  even though i gave  the credit card number over the phone he put me on speaker phone  still refusing to come into the business  and had me talk to someone at ahmos to put my credit card through embarrassing  standing on the sidewalk  giving my credit card number again i called back later  to explain the situation and describe the bad service the manager was not accommodating  instead telling me that he would speak to the driver twenty minutes later  the driver called me back to basically yell at me and demand to know why i hadnt left a tip and why i had called his manager   i think i wont be ordering ahmos again  which is a shame because their food is really good 
this place seeps of msg and gross frying oil ive been here once and i dont think ill ever go back  even if someone paid for my food there are plenty of other restaurants on the ave  go to those
aw hell no  we tipped 5 on a 1239 order 3 slices of pizza  1 order of garlic bread  cos we did delivery even though theyre pretty close went up and opened it to find that  1 the slices were stacked  and the cheese basically ripped off all the pizzas  2 the pizza was thin and soggy 3 i ordered chicken as a topping 40and got onions and garlic instead what 4 garlic bread was kind of tough  got stale when it cooled within the hour  which means it was stale bread that was just reheated  nope probably never again since theres a lot of pizza around la
ugh  terrible service and terrible food  j  i were in desperate need of nutrition after spending most of the morning trying to drag our hungover asses outta bed  nacho mamas was the first place we walked past  so we just decided to go in  we were seated outside and the waiter brought us water and some chips and salsa  we put in our order and waited in anticipation for our food  and then we waited and waited and waited some more  our chip supply had been gobbled up our water had been guzzled down  we were in dire straits  despite the fact that there were at least 8 servers and bussers and floor managers walking around  we were largely ignored  there were maybe two dozen patrons  so it wasnt even busy we asked 3 different guys for more water before we finally got some  the waiter reassured us that our food was on the way at least 4 times    40 minutes after we had ordered  our chopped salad and chicken nachos finally arrived  and they were totally wretched  gross  the beans in the nachos werent even whole beans  it was just some weird brownish liquid that tasted of beans but was weirdly flavored with some sweetish coconut stuff  the salad was just a salad and they only had one kind of dressing  some housemade citrus vinaigrette the guacamole was pretty tasteless as well  never going there again
this was the spot my first year then the racist bar tender told the police my friend was a criminal  they nearly kicked his door in  and proceeded to hold him and his fianc hostage only to realize they had the wrong people what caused the mix up the men were both black  needless to say since this incident ive never given this place a penny   the service was subpar this year anyway before this incident  my friends and i used to hang out here for a nice meal since the fool at our schools dc is subpar at best once thisone umass kid cant think of his name left  its been downhill ever since as far as service goes we always left him a 20 or better tip i hoped it helped   the food used to be amazing but earlier this year prior to the whole race debacle  i had some ribs that taste like they were never barbecued and were cold in the middle as if they were half cooked yuck   im never going here again
the service was really slow i believe it took 30 minutes to get my food after the order was placed i had the ranch skillet nothing impressive youd probably get something better at dennys for half the price the cinnamon dipped apples that came with it was disappointing too i believe it is their apple pie filling  which made me not want to order the apple pie i contemplated going again only for the red velvet waffle but after reading the other review  sounds like that is not even worth it
what the eff yamato  now i completely agree with jill t but heres my most recent yamato experience   yamato  i initially gave you four stars but with your horrific service and attitude towards your customers  i give you 1 star   my experience i came here with my friend sam n and my other friend patrick m i ordered shumai  which did not come until 15 hours later  with no apology  no nothing an hour and a half later for shumai this was supposed to be an appetizer this was supposed to come out before my sushi i was sad and hungry also  sam ns baked lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small  our waitress  never checked in on us which is also why my appetizer took too long and we were sitting right behind the hostess table  not to mention  it took forever to get our check and leave my best friend is a sushi waitress and i can understand the restaurant is busy  but it doesnt excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table  this is really not okay  the reason why i gave yamatos 1 star instead of 0 was because of jesse  my last waiter  who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention i never see at this restaurant i sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of yamato  daryl w has made an awesome point word of mouth is a powerful tool and i have already seen jill ts review on facebook with my fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it   peace out  yamato after the piss poor service and mediocre sushi  im out of here
toms is the worst restaurant on earth  but between naive columbia freshmen and tourists  every single booth is packed  all day and all night dont be fooled the food is awful  the waiters are surly  and everythings overpriced walk down broadway theres plenty of other diners that dont suck below 110th
sadly  i have had to update this review for a third time even though harlem tavern is just down the street from us 3 blocks  and we have tried time and time again to give this place a chance  our most recent visit was enough to repost  let me tell you a little story we arrived at 9pm for drinks because the barinside area was completely swamped  we asked for a table for three we waited around for 40 minutes in the crowded bar area  and were seated in the patio section at 945 as soon as we sat down  we met our waitress  a woman who put down the menus and said are you gonna order food we said no  we just sat down and have already eaten  just drinks id like to add she never once tried to sell us the food  just demand that we order something   a few minutes later  she comes back are you gonna order food you have to order food to sit here  this is my table because we had waited 45 minutes and were never told by the hostess that tables were only for food weve been here 1015 times in the past  and this was never the case we asked if shed make an exception because it was now 10pm and the hostess hadnt informed us  then she starts to tell us they have a new policy a few minutes later  she sends over another server to harass us about ordering food  again  who pleads you just need to order one appetizer  thats all after this  we were fed up and told the staff we would rather leave  she wouldnt bring us the check and disappeared as a result of such poor treatment  we didnt leave a tip   on our way out  we spoke to the hostess  who said the server went rogue and that there was no such policy she even said shed buy us a drink next time we visit i have no idea whether ht has a policy that requires all patrons at their table to order drinks  or if this was just one territorialinexperienced server  but either way we dont plan to return or recommend this joint to friends any longer   sorry  ht  but youre going to have to do a much better job training your staff if you want to succeed
oh man  i really rooted for this place  we were all so excited for a new spot opening in the neighborhood something thats soulful  and characteristic of harlem at large heck  its called harlem tavern  wrong  heres my list of complaints   bad food the mussels in garlic white wine and sweet potato fries were served coldgross but since i had to wait a while for my food  i didnt want to risk sending it back and have to starve for even longer the shrimp cerviche was also halfass done ive had the real stuff in south america so my standard is set high and sure  ive had comparable quality here in the city and lets just say  this cerviche is a 1 out of 10 based on authenticity and taste   limited menu expensive and apparently crappy appetizers  salads  and burgers they all had comparable prices so  theres not much of a price range in your menu choices   limited selection of beer for it to be called a beer gardentavern  its embarrassing that the local supermarket 3 blocks away has a better beer selection   tacky decoratmosphere again  i think we all wanted more character to this place the decor was boring and standard the paintings look like they were bought at a discount from walmart they were playing radio hits right  i really havent gotten enough of lady gaga from the radio alreadyit ressembles any of those tacky tourist joints at time square that i would never venture into and in this case  i only gave it a fair chance because it was brought to my neighborhood  i am thoroughly disappointed
silky tofu  delicious curries  mediocre thai iced tea oh and weird scraps of metal in my food but the waiter took the thai iced tea off the bill as a consolation the real consolation im still alive to write this tale
sorry hi rise  you lost a customer today and sorry  hipsterthanlife attendant  if your professional life didnt turn out the way you wanted  and now youre stuck serving coffee and pastries to people that you believe to be so below you but listen  the reality is that you work at a bakery and thats what you are there to do  serve coffee  pastries and sandwiches if you have any angst about the job you have to do  the customers are not to blame and theres no justification for such condescending and rude attitude ive been a customer for a while  but ive had enough of you  i do have one thing to thank you for because of your poor attitude  i walked away sans food and decided to get my breakfast sandwich over at crema what a great discovery  they had a huge assortment of delicious looking pastries  great sandwiches  and an upbeat  happy customer service
i was excited about indochinese fusion i had it in india best damn chicken corn soup i had  which is what lured me in they had chicken corn soup on the menu they had an appetizer  entree  dessert lunch deal going on for 12 i sat down for a solo lunch on the patio on a beautiful day  service was unacceptably slow  corn soup was a culinary disappointment  too corny  no other depth of flavor like thickened corn water with corn in it  desi chili chicken  i ate the bell peppers out of it because the chicken maybe the breading were inedibly salty inedible  waited an eternity read 25 minutes for the check guy even got my check and then forgot about me and i had to ask for it back and then when he came back he had split my 20 into smaller bills rather than use the money to pay the bill idk what was going on there  dessert was ice cream on a plate with sparse noodles around it   terrible  ok not that bad but i hate when bad food and bad service waste my time
i went to cardullos today with my husband to purchase champagne for some mimosas we were planning on making  we have washington state ids and were prompted to show them to the cashier  who also happens to be the owner  this was no surprise of course  shed want to check our ids before letting us purchase alcohol  however  she opened up a book that shows pictures of state ids to verify our id  and apparently our two washington state ids did not match the id images she had in her book  and she refused to let us purchase the champagne  while i appreciate her thoroughness  i am completely appalled that she would not let a married couple in our late twenties with multiple credit cards and harvard ids purchase champagne  our washington ids are from july 2010 we have no idea why they dont match the picture in her book  but clearly her book is outdated  and  if we really had fake ids  wouldnt we take even more care to make sure our ids match pictures in a book used to check for fake ids   i will never shop at cardullos ever again as a result of this humiliating and atrocious service  big mistake  huge
pros good food  interesting ambiance  cons extremely poor service that overshadowed the positives  in early february  i was planning an important dinner for a business friend in town visiting some graduate students  i thought upstairs would be the perfect place for an intimate dinner at one of my favorite upscale restaurants in cambridge  two weeks in advance  i made a reservation for 7 people at 830 pm on feb 15th on the upstairs  intimate dining level  the night before the dinner  i received a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for 830 pm  when we arrived at the restaurant  we were told in a joking manner that our table would be ready in 45 minutes we waited 30 minutes  and after not a single update from the host or hostess  i went to check in on the situation  apparently our table was still not ready  because the party before us arrived at 530 pm and still had not paid their bill  we were instead offered a crowded table on the noisy lower level a jazz band was playing which would not have worked for what i had planned to be an intimate  quiet dinner  when i told the hostess that this wouldnt work for us  she was indifferent and said there was nothing she could do  she ignored us from that point on  our party awkwardly waited near the jazz band for our table to be ready  and finally  at 930  an hour after i had scheduled the reservation  we were finally seated  after this atrocious service  i expected the host who seated us to offer us  at the very least  free drinks  but the host offered nothing and i was too embarrassed by the whole situation to even ask for anything  while the food ended up being fine and the service during the meal satisfactory  i am really upset that a restaurant of this caliber treated our party so poorly  i can understand that this was the day after valentines day and perhaps the restaurant was dealing with capacity issues for belated valentines day celebrations this is what the host told me after we finally were seated  however  the restaurant knew i had a reservation for 830 that night and should have planned accordingly   i am really disappointed with upstairs on the square i have frequented this restaurant a few times before and have never had such an issue   the restaurant screwed up pretty royally for what was a fairly important business dinner for me and i have no plans to visit this restaurant again
worstpizzaever   hifis pies dont come close to being north end pizza or even digiornos the crust is hard and tasteless  the cheese is used sparingly  and the sauce tastes like it could be tomato paste   if youre thinking of stopping by for lunch or dinner  definitely keep walkingyoull find something else in a oneblock vicinity this place is only worthy of the desperate  drunk college kids wandering around the central square area but guess what kiddos hate to disappoint you  but not everything tastes good when youre drunk  hifi pizza included
yuck  the only good thing that i can say about this pizza is that it was delivered pretty quickly  other than thati am totally disappointed  thick  greasy  flavorless crust  the veggies all tasted like they came out of a can slimy and even the cheese didnt taste good   i have been a happy beautys pizza customer for the past year  and regret branching out  i would never order from this place again
this place has some much going for it  that i am always surprised by how bad it is  awesome location  right outside of central  with parking  really good looking pastriesbut for some reason  it just doesnt work  it sucked when it was carberrys  and i was really hopeful that when lyndells bought it  it would get better  ive never been to the lyndells in somerville  but ive always heard good things  my biggest complaint is the people who work here  its like all of their employees are terrified of people  they run away rather than asking how they can help  and they do everything sooo sloooowwwly  normally  if im at a coffee shop in the morning instead of at home drinking my own coffee  its because im on m way to work  which probably means im in a hurry  which probably means i dont have 15 minutes to stand in line while the 4 people behind the counter accomplish absolutely nothing  the food tastes ok  nothing special  and majorly overpriced  i would love to have a great bakery right in central  and i would go all the time  ive learned that the bakery at whole foods is my best bet  and will continue to take my business there  good coffee  great pastries  helpful employeesand you can grocery shop while youre there  i just decided to give lyndells another shot today  because it always looks so temptingi literally stepped over a raw chicken breast right inside the door  when i politely mentioned it to the gal who made my sandwich  she acted like she couldnt care less  or why i would be bringing it to her attention  a raw chicken breast  on the floor  ewww   i will not be making this mistake again
first time in and ill never be going again seriously dont even bother going  common sense is something people should look into when hiring staff  i walked in  placed my togo order with the girl at the front  specifically first order not for me  then my order  then an appetizer   i paid and change was 51 cents not that complicated but she somehow gave me 11 cents small issue but ridiculous that she looked confused when i said it wasnt 51 cents   i told her i was going to wait outside for the order she said ok and that it would be 20 min my phone died so i lost track of time but when i went back to check on the order because it seemed like a long time she said here you go i asked how long had it been ready and she said 10 min i assume she just thought it would be a good idea for me to wait outside till they closed and then maybe i would go in and check on my food she just stood there and didnt know what to say i think a so sorry would have sufficed  the kicker was she put both orders of sushi rolls in the same container it was two orders only reason i was particular was because im allergic to seafood and i had the veggie rolls while my friend did not   never again no way no how
ridiculously understaffed only 2 waitersbartenders working on friday night thirty minute wait to order and then to pay
chicken kitchen  clean your kitchen  and the rest of the place while youre at it so  ive been wanting to try this place for a while  its close to the gym  the menu promises to be good and i love some rotissed chicken  heres my story walked in at 7pm and the restaurant is moderately busy  i see there is a family meal that i can get to go and opt for it  too bad there was no rotisserie whole chickens availableat the dinner hour no less  i was told there would be some in 10 minutes  so i decide to wait  i grab a seat and begin to check out the place big mistake  dirty  dirty dirty birds here  the kitchen area needed a serious cleaning and the chopped chickens looked rather dry read  old on the grill  the dining area had not been attended to in quite a while either  after my 10 minute impromptu inspection  i decided this was not the place for me  chicken kitchen  too bad i did not get to taste the food  but i think it just was not meant to be  call me when you get your act together and clean up a bit
i want to start off saying this place went from great to horrible over the past few years  i have heard that they changed ownership  i went last sunday and ordered a hamburger and fries  guess what i got food poisoning  because two hours later i was so sick  my wife ordered the mango chicken salad  well there was hardly any mango three and a half small strips and almost no dressing  the service was okay  but it took a while before the food came out  my friends in line before me had their food 10 minutes earlier    i had the italian cream cake for dessert  but it was okay at best  so basically if you are looking for overpriced mediocre food that potentially can cause food poisoning  then this is your place
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed  on my most recent visit  the waiter was overbearing  the menu confusing  and the food unremarkable  avoid this place
they had mints at the door when  you left  that is about the only nice thing i can say
i cannot adequately express the shame i feel for having the nerve to suggest this place for a mini girls night out i think eileen c already broke it down but i just have to put my 2 cents in and say this place has some nerve it was seriously empty and still we were brushed off like some drop in visitors which we were but hello they are a restaurant wait oh i get it now it wasnt a restaurant that makes much more sense it was an empty room of tables with rude people avoiding eye contact with the confused people who had the audacity to walk in makes much more sense  it is crazy to me that i gave this place 5 stars before i was vegetarian at the time  that is the only excuse i can think of the shame
do you enjoy fragrant  exotically spiced indian food made with fresh  flavorful ingredients if so  this place is not for you hunger  and the absence of a wait drove us to palace of india one warm friday evening when all other princeton restaurants were hopping i looked forward to fulfilling my craving for good biryani which was among the dishes featured in the very reasonably priced dinner buffet   well  as my husband astutely noted  you get what you pay for and no wonder there wasnt a wait i couldnt believe that every buffet item was bland and the harsh  unpleasant textures immediately extinguished my appetite i usually love warm creamy palak spinach with soft cubes of paneer cheese here  the grainy  fibrous palak and hard  rubbery paneer was clearly undercooked the vegetable korma may as well have been dessert given how sweet it was the chicken tandoori was slimy and cold actually all the food was cold after a few bites id had enough   id last visited this establishment a while back when it was known as kalluri corner and the food at that time was decent i suspect the management or ownership has changed  hence the poor quality i will not be going back here and neither should you
so let me begin by saying that  in my experience  i can leave an establishment happy  even if the food or product is semi mediocre  if the employees demonstrate sincere and friendly customer service with that stated  the food at cielo is not excellent  it isnt terrible either however  i could have been pleased if the staff we encountered had been actually sincere and friendly not fakefriendly theres a huge difference either way  heres an account of my latest experience  three girlfriends and i arrive at 10 minutes to 6 when their happy hour ends on a wednesday afternoon we were seated promptly  at a table with no napkins or silverware  and a busser quickly brought us chips  salsa and waters our server however  took almost 10 minutes to approach us when she did  we asked if we could still receive the happy hour discount on drinks and appetizers at that very moment we could hear the clock chiming 6 at the mission  and our server simply said only if its before 6 not a yes or a no she evaded the question with a passive answer  even though all of us could clearly hear the clock chiming 6 pm i told her  politely  we arrived 10 minutes ago and were looking forward to the happy hour prices  hinting with out being outright rude  that wed appreciate the discount since it is barely turning 6pm and we had been sitting there for 10 minutes well  she said shed check with her manager  we each ordered a drink and an appetizer i ordered wine  but tasted my friends passion fruit margarita it was fine  but oddly thick even though it was on ice and not blended kinda weird  but flavorful i ordered the ceviche  which was good  nothing spectacular  but good like i mentioned before maybe i would be happier with the place in general if the service was better  but i think poor service makes the food taste worse when our food came we still didnt have napkins or silverware and our waters were all empty i had to ask for napkins and water refills she brings the napkins but no silverware they are roll ups so i figured my statement went without further explanation we needed the full roll up  silverware and all however  apparently she was too distracted to notice we didnt have silverware my friend asked for a fork  and she giggled oh  i didnt realize you didnt have silverware well duh  youre only our server  arent you paid  to notice these things weve only been here for 30 and youve walked past our table 20 times frustrating  needless to say  we receive our bill and no discount was applied for the happy hour specials i didnt bother bringing it up with her we paid the full prices  which are a bit expensive  and went on our way  i just dont understand  why when all it would have taken on their part was to give us the happy hour prices just priceless moments after the clock chimed 6pm  and we would have all left much happier terrible first impression of a new restaurant in a very crucial economy for new businesses  on a positive  i also really enjoyed their chips they have flour and corn tortilla chips a nice touch i havent had most places
is it really so hard in a city the size of atlanta to have reasonably good asian food in midtown     i like the location of mu lan and the cute house it is in  but the food is the same as one would get in a suburban strip mall in anywhere  usa  disappointing  i know my standards can be high i lived in southeast asia for a few years but  really  why is it so hard for a city the size of atlanta to get some good ethnic food that doesnt require a drive to buford highway
i wish i liked this place   i live upstairs and it has a cute patio  but the food that used to be average seems to have gone downhill  and the prickly pear margarita i used to enjoy seems to have been changed and now is too sweet and ive tried it on different occasions  wasnt just one day with one bartender    i had a craving for nachos the other day and went there for convenience  and ate about 4 bites  really  how can you mess up nachos     service is also slow  inattentive  and faulty   the last several times i have been ive had to ask for a side of salsa twice different serversbut somehow no one can remember to bring salsa  i havent tried the pizza portion of the menu i dont really get the concept of pizza plus mexican anyway  so i cant comment on that  until reading reviews  i never noticed the low health inspection score  but sadly it doesnt surprise me  prickly pear  you literally need to clean up your act
ive been here 3 times  the first time was on a pub crawl  a couple years ago  and i only had beer  and it was pretty good i like to try new beers and they have a good selection  the second time was also pretty good no complaints  so why the one star well i went here last weekend for dinner and drinks before a movie  and i went home with more than i bargained for food poisoning after spending a day over the toilet and another day in bed too weak to move  i will never go here again i probably wont even be able to walk by without dry heaving
worst restaurant ever
last week  four friends and i went to hirise on a wednesday  after getting our food  we went upstairs to try to find a table  the place was full of people camped out with laptops and coffee at 4top tables  when we asked a staff member if there was anywhere else to sit remember  were all standing around holding a basket in one hand and a drink in the other she said no and disappeared  we ended up eating in the conference roomtheater of the next door community center  with the curtains drawn  bottom line get takeout  or eat outside if its nice but dont come expecting to eat in
i dont like the texture of the crust i know thats what people go for when they come here and they enjoy the flakiness  but it is just not my cup of tea the crust to topping ratio of some of the pizzas that i got were also not good   the mixtures of toppings are pretty creative  but other than that  im just not into it its the crust that really throws me off
like shrada a read her review  i wish there was a 0star option my experience was almost as horrible as hers    the service  experience   we walk into the restaurant  and we stand at the front for a full 3 minutes waiting to be seated  even though the restaurant is empty the two employees at the register kind of glance over and continue their conversation  the waitress comes up to us  and right of the bat asks  for here or to go we say for here  and sit down she then comes to us in a few minutes and says in an annoyed tone  i thought you said to go she rudely props two glasses on the table and gives a exasperated sigh  the whole time the waitress has a look on her face like she just defaulted on her house loan  was hit by a pie on the way to work  and slapped by every customer that ate there today  every few minutes shed come by the tablenot to fill up water  but to eavesdrop can you believe this   she had a look like we had just murdered her children and she was trying to find out where we had hid the bodies so then she could kill us once she got that info   the food   terrible if the food has been even average  i may have given 1 star it wasnt   some of the most bland  uninspired trash i have ever eaten i think i can get a better meal out of a barn trough the potatoes were basically swimming in a curry that was water  and the cholay were served uncooked right out of the can  lukewarm and bland   parting ways   the waitress literally throws the check on the table  without us even asking for it i kind of wanted to get up right there and give her a piece of my mind  but i didnt want to ruin my mood for the bar we were going to next doorwhich by the way had been playing earsplitting music the whole time so loud the water in the glass was vibrating  this is absolutely the worst treatment i have gotten in my life  at a restaurant or otherwise this happened about a month ago but i didnt have the time to write and i agree with shradha  the free market needs to send this rathole a message

the food moderately priced but hardly good  maybe i shouldnt judge based on my one experience  but both my friend and i left with upset stomachs    theres much better curry in berkeley  get out of your comfort zone and stay away from these chains
overrated  the insane amount of sugary toppings testify to the fact that cinnaholics baseline cinnamon roll just isnt impressive  the texture is too squishy and everything is just unbearably sweet  vegan treats are no new thing
food is okay ive had better japanese food its not as expensive as joshuyas but the food quality is quite distinguishable  unfortunately  but why am i complainingtheyre supposed to be open till 10pm   10 pm my butt  not tooooo upset because at least it means theyre treating their workers well not working them overtime  but from a customers perspective  not too cool my friend and i practically ran here from the bart so we can make it on time got there at 930 but they refused to serve us because it was too close to closing boo
i would actually give this place a 05 stars if i could not only was the food bleh  the service was absolutely terrible the men working there were probably the rudest ive ever seen eating there for dinner with friends  some of us took our time trying to guzzle down the nasty food while trying to enjoy a nice conversation after about 30 minutes  one of the workers comes over to ask us to eat faster and telling us this is not a cafeteria hes sure right about thatthe school cafeteria has both better food and nicer workers
not excited about this place fine  i give a star for having tart yogurt and having okay toppings the fruit was okay  but some of it seemed canned and sugared  the yogurt tasted a bit grainy and even watered down the tart yogurt could be much creamier but it tasted like it was watered down   i wonder how they clean the machinesconsidering how many they have they cant clean all the machines every day especially when they clse late   and honestly  i think i would pay a bit more for quality im not excited to see piles of trash that cant be composted this is berkeley we need to learn to help our environment   sometimes it scares me to think what kind of germs live on the handles and spouts when a lot of people have touched it then  i saw some kids quickly putting their heads under the yogurt spout to eat itseriously not pleasing
no way  seriously no way  theres two types of yogurteven pinkberry got sued for using powder form and this one def tastes like powder formmaybe thats why theyre called italian delicacy instead of frozen yogurt  i dont know but ive tried it on different occassions and i really cant stand that it tastes artificialnot like yogurt at all  the  fruits were okay but there were various canned fruits like peaches and bluberries im not looking to buy things like thatid rather have it fresh since im putting money into it definately would rather go to yogurt harmony
overpriced and skimpy servings the place actually on telegraph just around the corner is far better
um  i was surprised at the amount of people that like this place  i mean there was nothing good about my experience there the shakespeare sucked ass  the sounds were loud enough  just indistinguishable everything about this sucked  and i had a pissed off girl she was not happy with my choice thank you shakespeare tavern
so  let me preface this by saying that i am a native new yorker i have spent most of my life there  and they do hot dogs pretty well any dirty water dog is far superior than the shit this place parades around as food the buns are trash  the food is trashits hard to ruin a hot dog  the place was packed for some unknown reason  and the staff doesnt seem to give 2 shits about anything i have no idea why this place is an atlanta institution  i have no idea how it is still open i will never go back  and my life is far worse from going in the first place they should just replace this place with a cardboard factory  or concrete factory  and atlanta would be far better served
72309 update the health department shut them down today  maybe tom will come out of the woodwork and start cooking again when they reopen  dont go until he does  this place use to be great  the best thai in seattle  and it was well worth the wait  the cramp quarters  the noise  to marvel at the cooking skills of tom  but now  well now tom is who knows where  on a thia beach perhaps taking it easy   and the people working there just dont give a dam in fact theyll tell you straight to your face you can go elsewhere we have many more behind you  now days  being asked to change seats  even midmeal is not uncommon it happened to us and the table next to us tonight  the prices are up and the quality is down  and its still just as noisy and cramped as before    if this restaurant was anywhere else in the city they couldnt get away with treating customers like they do  please  go elsewhere and let these jackasses get the message they need to treat customers with respect  just say no to thai tom 
granted  i was there only two weeks after opening  so they may have been just getting in the rhythm of menu choices and service  however  running out of three different dishes on the menu  the wine was a rip off  at 10 a glass for a small pour  not going back again
terrible service  food good im familiar with callendars menu  way outdated decor  the place needs a complete redo  the hostess ended up helping us with our order because the waiter was so slow  too bad  because marie callendars used to be so popular
warning warning warning   do not enter if you are  a 33  b sober   mind you  im usually a make the most of any situation kinda girl but dang last night came here for karaoke after game 7  go lakers  i had a sudden impulse to line up all the obnoxious  belligerent  20something undergrads together and knock them all over with a bowling ball   highlight of my night here was when this stupid blond girl kept interrupting everyones karaoke song and was on stage beatboxing and singing along louder than the singer i asked the karaoke dj to turn off her mic since she was being so rude and annoying and when he did  i took absolute pleasure in seeing her tap on her mic and shake it to see what was wrong with it haha cheap thrills  
their table service might be one thing  but i ordered delivery tonight and it was a disaster  the food came more than an hour late a good 90 minutes after the initial order was made  and was ice cold  the restaurant did not call me to warn that the food would be coming late  i had to call them  i guess my tonkatsu was good once  but it was slimy and congealed by the time it reached me  wont be ordering again  wont be making a visit stay away from this joint
ouch the absolute worst brunch service ive ever experienced took almost 30 minutes and asking 3 times to get my cup of coffee  and a little longer than that to get my bloody mary ordered at the same time  food was pretty standard brunch fare  too many other options like zingermans to ever go back
i just cant recommend this place  unless youre interested in mediocre food at high prices served by inattentive waiters  the only reason i went here was to bring a group of family and friends this was convenient and could easily handle a large group otherwise  id never  ever go back
im amazed that this place has a 4 star rating  came here today and paid 10 for a giant size sandwich not only does the sandwich have barely any meat on it  but i could probably get a better sandwich down the street at fresh grocer  or subway for that matter roast beef and turkey is dry and tastes old  and for a place that calls themselves a deli to only have 3 types of cheeses is a little ridiculous   maybe i should try it for the egg sandwiches
pattaya grill is unfortunately the only thai restaurant in university city that delivers it is also terrible my girlfriend and i ordered simple thai dishes house salad  papaya salad  pad seeyu  and spicy squid all of these dishes were below average  with the exception of the squid which was inedible it was rubbery and not even cut in peices the house salad also was about as average as a side salad you would get an italian restaruant unless you absolutely need thai food delivery  dont order from this place go out or pick it up or get something else
i have been a few times  and i hate to give it a bad review  but here goesnormally  id give this place 3 stars good location university city  great food deals cheap wings not fantastic but cheap in price  1 tacos  3 for more substantial tacos are economical but ya get what you pay for  really also has generally good drink specials  but lacks on the higher quality brews that i generally go for all in all it  it is great for when you are a hungry undergrad that wants to get drunk with friends on campus perfect  good for you heres the bad part  service has always been terrible for the handful of times i have gone there their waitstaff doesnt seem to give a shit if they get your order correct the waitresses can look hot til the day is long but if you cant bring me what i ordered  go work at a strip joint   also  on our last visit  will be the last time we will ever go there we had the pleasure of finding a piece of broken glass in one of our pints some background for you my friends  i are phdeducated and very respectable citizens that kept our cool and brought this to the attention of the manager  mike mike said we didnt have to pay for the drinks we had ordered well  that was nice of him  until he lied to us turns out  he left the most expensive pitcher on our bill  so again we asked to speak to the manager mike in the full force of a complete asshole blew us off when we tried to explain to him that a trip to the er would have been thousands of dollars more expensive then a 9 pitcher my good friend almost swallowed the piece of jagged glass seriously  what complete degenerates do they have running that place
t bowl deserves an award for being the biggest insult to asian cuisine in philadelphia this place somehow manages to do the impossible and give you everything you wouldnt want to happen to a stir fry what makes a stir fry good well for one thing it uses high quality ingredients  remains unsaturated with oil when flash fried  and has juicy bits of meat scattered in and around the bowlrice  so what does t bowl do wrong let me outline it for you as follows  1 the chicken is probably the driest piece of meat you could ever sink your teeth into it sucks the moisture out of your mouth and tastes like its been cooked days in advance i dont appreciate cotton mouth for lunch  2 your stir fry is greasy as hell you could probably squeeze out a few ounces if you tilted your plate and fried a few eggs with it  3 the rice tastes like death its crumbly and old whoever made it obviously isnt getting paid enough   4 the whole concept is flawed its a fast casual restaurant that has a cool customization theme to the dishes that caters to students and then it overcharges you for everything  to the very last spring onion  5 the presentation of the dish sucks it just sucks have a little finesse in your presentation it takes 5 seconds to make the plate look infinitely more appetizing than seeing the oil splashes all around the dish   6 wtf kind of sauces are you offering what a terrible range of westernized tastes each one attempts to drown out the stale taste of the ingredients which i suppose was the objective  this was an even worse business decision than taglios  which actually tasted good on occasion   i was so excited to hear about this place when it opened  but never have i been more disappointed   what a shame  15
horrible lunch service  we waited 5 minutes to be seated  10 minutes to get menus  and 15 minutes for water when we finally got our burgers we werent able to flag down a waiter to bring us ketchup eventually we got so sick of waiting that my friend just walk up to the shortorder counter to snag the ketchup  never again
pro location is great  con sandwiches are bland and thoroughly mediocre  the caesar salad i got today was 7  and it had almost no caesar dressing  it did have a mound of supermarket lettuce and four burnt croutons  no thanks  coho  treehouse has a 5 caesar salad that is about twenty times better
absolute travesty of a burger asked if it was from frozen patties  and they told me no not positive  but im pretty sure i got a microwaved frozen patty utterly disgusting
you know when you hear something so disagreeable you bypass anger and move straight to sadness best burger in providence i honestly feel ashamed it is inedible as in i hadnt eaten in hours  had a few beers in me  love burgers more than almost anything  and still couldnt get past two bites it is a greasy pile of processed garbage unfit for human consumption onion rings sucked  too
first visit and never again irish bar my shamrock arse tattoo  20 minutes to get a waitress attention  and she was shocked by the order of two guinness and two shots of jack  she then disappeared for another 10 minutes and left promising us a menu 20 minutes later  we got a menu i looked at the food landing on the tables around us  and was not impressed with the theme of straight from the freezer to the fryer and talked my companion into going next door to the istanbul we spent an hour at oneals  30 minutes waiting for a drink  and the rest wondering what the hell was so popular about the place
update  i tried them again  just to give them another shot i dined in this time and ordered the same plate of drunken noodle yup  still bad  greasy and gross my friends laughed at me for taking the same risk with the same dish well  jokes on you guys  for eating at the same restaurant with me your dishes werent much better  either suckas  well  at least this time around  i got flat rice noodles
i ordered fordelivery on campusfoodcom  no complaints on this end  the food was quick and delivery was only 1    however  the food left a lot to be desired  i ordered general tsos tofu with fried rice  being vegan  i requested the fried rice to not include egg and they obliged  however  it seems egg is the only thing they put in their fried rice  because i basically got white rice that tasted really  really funky  ive never gone to a chinese food restaurant and had this experience  the general tsos tofu had an incredibly liquidy  noiwontstayonyourbroccoli sauce which in my experience is abnormal  as i have a bit of a general tsos sauce obsession  but the tofu was alright  it just really wasnt very good  at all  i definitely wont be coming back here  certainly not after experiencing the pleasurable dining experience i had at peking garden
i gave this so many stars because their wine was good  was in town visiting friend and she took me here  oh boy ordered the mac and cheese with pork first of all my plate had a hair  disgusting and the taste of the plate was horrible  never again the service was pretty decent though
avoid this place    it is obscenely overpriced  258 for a slice of cheese pizza   everything else is ridiculously overpriced  400 for a small french fries  they keep jacking up the prices  and lowering the quality  they also keep hiring new counter help  who dont understand the concepts of gloves and tongs    just dont bother  if you want cheap  fast pizza during lunch time  go across the street to star market  which has decent pizzabytheslice for lunch during the week  if you want tasty pizza  go down windsor street to the bertuccis on main  if youre looking for something other than cheap pizza  you were at the wrong place to begin with
dear lord  this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to  especially in terms of takingmaking orders correctly and thats really saying something
the only good thing about this place is the selection of 5 footlongs  the people making my sandwich were unfriendly there were no smiles on their faces  and they practically barked at me when they asked for my preferences sandwich making wasnt so hot either the veggies were unevenly spreads out  and the lady cut and wrapped my sandwich without even trying to close the sandwich made eating it so much more difficult than it needed to be  i really wish that i had read these yelp reviews before coming here the 5 spent on this sandwich could have been made for better use at a local restaurant
my first visit was a few days ago  but never the less  as i remember the soft savory deliciousness of my lamb shank  the couscous raining down my throat and the bouquet of roses that blossomed in my mouth with every sip of my lemonade  i drool im really starting to salivate now and need to push my key board out of drools way   the appetizer portions are for one person strange  i know  so dont go into getting an appetizer thinking youll share with a friend   the neighborhood is quiet and the restaurant is cozy  staff is very pleasant  and i am officially a fan  terrifically tasty tunisian treats for the tummy
i dont know why anyone eats ice cream anymore
im not a vegetarian or vegan  so when this place was recommended to me  i was skeptical i decided to try it  though  and it is so delicious i have been here a bunch recently and i havent had a bad dish  to order here  you choose one of three pizza dough  brown rice  or coconut rice and an entree to go on top they have daily specials which are delicious and soups of the week i just recently had tomato and lentil soup which was delicious  also  it is a small space and is part of a music club  club passim you will be asked upon entering if youre there for the show or for dinner you may have to wait for a table  especially if you have 4 people  and takeout is always a fast  delicious option also  before 4 or 5pm  there are no waiters  so you just place your order through a window to the cook  it is a little hard to find  take a look at the pictures on yelp its a basement and connected to club passim  so if youre going here at night  you may hear music from the club just follow that and youll figure it out  they also have 2 beers on tap and desserts
sensational  an adult cupcake with oozyfilling  buttercream frosting was to die for  at last nights victory party  i ate a yummy meyer lemon cupcake  a coffeeflavored one  and a chocolate one    im not usually a cupcake fanatic  but these were delicious f
i just went last week the restaurant gets 5 stars because the staff is excellent friendly  knowledgeable  the food is superb  and the ambiance is great  one warning i went expecting real southern food i went with my mother  from texas  and father  from virginia  and told them it was southern it is not traditional southern  but still delicious my mom and dad both said it was great  just not real southern  i had the catfish  my mom had the chicken  my dad had the pork i loved the catfish  and my parents loved their dishes for desert  we had the peach melba that was the most delicious desert i can remember having if you go  get the melba its seasonal so get it while it lasts
this place is great they have a lot of cocktails  so you can go here plenty of times without having to drink the same drink twice  and they are all great they also have good beer and a pretty big wine list  though ive never had wine here  the food looks amazing  but i havent had dinner here yet i have had the chips and dip  though both the chips and the dip are homemade and so amazingly delicious  i wont look at chips the same way again  sundays are stout  oyster night  where with every stout you get  you also get a free oyster i love sundays here wednesdays are mexicantheme and they have a whole list of cocktails made with tequila they also have a mexicantheme snack list for wednesdays both nights are fun and delicious  the atmosphere is maybe the best part  for me green street has a cozy  intimate feeling while still having a chic feel the music is usually soul and funk  which i love  but there are other styles mixed in  the staff is friendly  and good at their jobs  if youre having a hard time finding the place  youre not alone it looks sketchy from the outside  but is amazing on the inside the best advise i have is to look at the pictures on yelp if you take a look at them  youll have a much easier time finding it
being so far away from pinkberry makes me a little sad  but now theres the bigger and better berry line a mere hour away in nearby boston though i wouldnt trek it just for froyo would i  tasting that good and still low fat is a beautiful thing regular flavor never gets old its smoother and creamier than pinkberry and definitely less tart  which is why berry line trumps pinkberry now i can add pineapple topping without my glands going wild  topping choices include your cereals  fruits  and chocolates personal fav fruity pebbles  banana  and mochi inside is quaint and cute as a button makes you want to sit and talk about happy thoughts
any visit to central will almost guarantee a visit to miracle partly because my friend works here  but morely because i just frickin love the vibe  the black top tables remind me of my chemistry labs everytime i walk in my eyes divert directly to that triangle table in the middle my mind runs and i picture myself having one too many beers  stumbling  and whacking my head right on the pointy part ha ha  anyways beers keep flowing  staff is laidback burgers jumbo  juicy steakeggs and very importantly their veggie burgers are the best ive ever tasted in my entire existence probably has a lot to do with the sauce its incredibly great
flippin fantastic  our dinner here last week was definitely 5 star quality  the wine  steak  sides and service were all top notch  i liked the atmosphere a lot too  it wasnt too dark and even though the place was packed for a wednesday night you feel the isolation within your area  im a booth girl  so was a bit disappointed the only booths available were by the kitchen  so we opted for a table  if youd like a booth in a nice area  mention this when making reservations  they have tons of wine to choose from  the waiter was given free reign to choose from a white for us and he did an excellent job  i love the smaller entree selection  there are only three options  but i got the filet and the scalloped potatoes and it was the perfect size  as another reviewer mentioned  the service was great  but not overbearing  they give you plenty of time to finish your bottle and chat and leave at your own pace
five stars for some of the best pearls ive tasted in the bay area  theyre soft  chewy  and theyre not too sweet  plus  at 150 for a green tea with pearls  its a steal  id definitely come here more often if i lived in berkeley and not san jose  p
i work remotely  so the world is my office my tools my trusty laptop my search for free wifi led me to sip nursing a hangover from the previous night of rooftop debauchery  a bar was not what i had in mind  but i was drawn in by the lowkey  friendly atmosphere although i only ordered iced coffee  the waitress brought over a generous heaping of free tapas  a spread that included olives  bruschetta  and garlic  and never was i under any pressure to vacate my table the dj kept the vibe going spinning downtempo hiphop ill definitely be back for drinks when i dont have to work
boy oh boy  were my taste buds in for a treat after being warmly greeted by the coownerhostessipoddj  we started with poached pears baked in raw honey with roquefort and drizzled with balsamic dressing and complemented by wine from nextdoor  byob and no corkage how deliciously affordable the other owner  her husband  stopped by our table to chat us up  he has managed nightclubs and restaurants in nyc for the better part of 15 years and is a charismatic whirlwind but back to the food  my friend went with the forest mushroom ragout stewed with tofu  carrots  spicy sprouts and caribbean beans  while i opted for free range chicken breast marinated in lime jus and jerk spices with chevre and papaya puree so tender  moist  and dripping with taste that sounded dirty  didnt it but im talking about some damn good cooking and the portions so generous even little miss piggy here couldnt finish her supper when it came to dessert however  this little piggy had none
before i found cheese n stuff  i ate top ramen then i told myself no  i will not have that stereotypical college ramen  so i started eating at chipotle yeah  im original you dont have to tell me but thank you anyways  well i was too much a stingy bastard for chipotle so i switched to 3 6inch sandwichs from subway  but deep inside  i was disappointed  like a chain smoker who switched to nicotene patches but one day  one glorious day  i saw a little sign that said cheese n stuff and i wondered wtf is stuff is it wine crackers koala bears well i went in and found out  stuff is cheap  delicious sandwiches made to order from a variety of breads  cheeses  meats  and toppings its also salads that i havent tried but all that matters are the sandwiches seriously  go get one now youre wasting too much time reading this shit
i love the sandwiches here  the honey oat bread is thick and so good  they are huge too  whenever i come to berkeley  i have to eat here conveniently located on telegraph where there is always a huge line out the door  they also have great salads  fresh tossed with fresh ingredients  sometimes they add too much dressing though good cheap prices especially for a starving student at cal  a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner
yum  i ordered the nacho boy from nacho boy  and it was nothing but pure unadulterated deliciousness  roast beef  avocado  shrooms and melted swiss cheese stuffed inside a sourdough roll and made dirty  you gotta get it dirty this is my new favorite sandwich  call in your order or wait a hour in line and another half hour for the sandwich  this ikes place is located inside the engineering building at stanford university  i have also been to the one in sf  this one is closer and just as good but parking was not ideal  metered visitor parking sucks man   i love sandwiches and i love ikes place
i cant comment on the food here but the ice cream is great  i tried the pistachio and it was a huge green scoop on a cake cone  everytime i go to palo alto  i try to make a trip here their ice cream is homemade and delicious  prices are really cheap too  this place is kind of hidden because its in a neighborhood and stands alone  cute old school diner type atmosphere  only open monday through fridays from 7am5pm
i wish there was a wegmans in northern california  this place has everything  i swear  there is a fresh bakery  ready to eat hot foods  pharmacy  fresh produce  video store  amazing meat and cheese selection  dry cleaners and a lot more  this place is like costco except you dont have to buy things in bulk  it is one of my favorite things about the east coast i could come here everyday and find something new to enjoy  prices are normal supermarket prices and food is insanely gourmet  it is also open 24 hours a day for those college students who get the midnight munchies i am counting the days till wegmans comes to california  i will be there with bells on
fresh cookies  soft or crispyyou decide  but either way they are delicious  this time i ordered the turtle and double chocolate chip with its a goody  i enjoyed it except for little bits of hardened toffee from the turtle cookie  but the cookie by itself is awesome  just not meant to be with ice cream unless you have strong teeth or like it really crunchy  its a good was so good    i also got the chocolate milk to go with my ice cream sandwich which was already filled with tons of chocolate  i think i oded on chocolate that dayi couldnt finish my chocolate milk  it was so good  but my body can only handle so much at once  but it was all worth it  im salivating right now just writing this review  ps cash only
ib hoagies was one of my favorite joints at cal  i still go to berkeley just for the curly cheese fries  cheese fries  anything they have cheese on lol  its a college town fast food joint filled with yummy deliciousness  the cheese is the creamy kind not the real melted cheese  its ooey goey cheese sauce that just makes everything taste so good  i prefer coming here over the cheese steak house when i crave for more veggies  i love the sliced lettuce  mayo  tomatoes  pickles  the works  i usually order the chicken philly and its always juicy  it lets me feel a little less guilty for gorging on an order of curly cheese fries on my own lol  i heart ib hoagies 
yay love this place they are open late they accept cash and credit card credit cards they charge a little extra though their portions are huge and their quick super close to cal  so after class i would just hop on over   service its a order and sit down place all the guys working there pretty friendly i never had a problem with it   food the food is awesome for the price  alfredo fettuccine with mushroom  loved it the pasta was al dente  which i loved because most fast place always over cook the pasta  cannoli  yummy it fixes my sugar craving  calzone  super huge but its worth it it can actually be split into two to share or to have for lunch and dinner good breadtoppings ratio   overall i would definitely recommend this place
fine dining  no  good  hearty americanized chinese food  yes  ive always had excellent food and service at china garden  the location next to schnucks is super convenient  easy to stop by on the way home or for a quick run on weekends  i almost always get mine to go  which must be the case for most of their business  food is cooked to order and is super fast about 10 min  portions are large i get two meals from a single order  unlike many chinese restaurants  the flavor of the food isnt overwhelmed by generic seasoning or msg  the egg drop soup the large is a quart has nursed me through many colds and its ridiculously cheap  i appreciate their vegetarian options and theyve always accommodated special requests  their vegetarian spring rolls are gigantic  its chinese fast food  but its fresh  tasty  and a bargain
the ribeye is the best for the greatest steak in town
thanks to big grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients  i went there with my husband for our anniversary  but i can easily see going back for a more casual meal  or even for drinks and bar snacks    every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff  we had the chicken liver pate  bistro filet  house made sausage  and the tater tots  everything we tasted was delicious  i cant wait to go back and work my way through the menu
definitely worth 5 stars  you wont get ambiance  but you will get amazing food
this cafe is wonderful  the atmosphere is bright and cheery  the coffee is wonderful especially the iced soy mocha  and the staff is always super courteous  there is a nice patio in back to enjoy outside seating and there is always great art on the walls
wonderful food and an amazing addition to our community
this is the real deal
i have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly i love trying new things and i am never disappointed  my dad has helped them with a batch of beer  they have made reeses vodka just for my mom and honestly  whenever i go with them to eat its like i walk onto the set of cheers everybody knows their name  but you dont have to be a regular to feel like youre getting special treatment i love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging i love the location  i love the feel i just wish i had more money so i could visit them more often
i really like this place for two reasons  1 the restaurant  bar remind me of legitirish bars that i went to in the nice areas of dublin  the bar and decor are perfect for creating an irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar    2  the food is great  they have a great brunch menu featuring legitirish breakfasts that are the same as the ones ive had in dublin  their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly
this place has great sushi  they have great monday night specials 1 pieces of sushi  3 sake which i love to take advantage of  i really love the big roll  the beef roll  and the dynamite roll  pheonix is an off the menu roll that you can order which comes out on a plate set on fire  mixed drinks are really good there too
two words to describe this joint outstanding bbq  if you eat meat  this is a place you have to try  great ribs  great pork  great brisket  the wait is always really long to get a table cause the food is fantastic  but the space is a bit small for the demand
this place is tiny  which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door  but dont be dissuaded everything ive tried has been fresh and flavorful  and absolutely not drowning in grease which is often my complaint when it comes to mexican food  particularly in the midwest my current favorites are the guacamole  veggie chalupas  and pumpkin flower quesadillla im slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as i return and return again  snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections yum  lately ive been calling for takeout more often because the logistics of getting to maize and finding space are not always easy and so i would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike  car parking bike rack  please but that doesnt seem to be worth knocking off a star  and other than that  i wouldnt want them to change anything
im a mostlyveggie eater  and i love this place their portabello sandwich is among the best ive ever had  apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully the catfish is also delicious love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides i highly recommend the sweet potato fries and  if its summer  the smoked sweet corn yum as most everyone else has said  the meats are also delicious  according to my husband and the tons of people weve brought here for lunch or dinner  their tap list is relatively small  they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time  but theres always lovely choices recently  theres been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin  apple fall beers bar and food service sometimes seems rushed  but surprisingly good for how busy they get  this place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours 30min wait at 830pm on a wednesday  but it has still become our default for outoftown guests that says a whole heck of a lot
best breakfast in cu  the courier breakfast is fantastic  especially with the sausage links  which are essentially english bangers  delicious  when anyone visits town  i make a point to take them to courier because it is such a good representation of what cu has to offer  the coffee selection is almost always great  and service is typically delightful
my friend and i celebrated his birthday here last night and the experience was perfect we were initially given a table very close to a party of four  but they quickly moved us to another table at our request the wine list was pretty broad and we enjoyed a bottle of aligot  a light white wine the bread  which features a different herb daily  was delicious with the butter sweetened with honey the mac  cheese appetizer was excellent  but the risotto was a little salty the butternut squash soup with crme frache was great while the idaho rainbow trout was prepared without much fanfare  it was a welcome change to such places like salt of the earth which drowns many of its dishes in an overabundance of disparate ingredients finally  the milk chocolate pot de crme was pure bliss it wasnt too sweet and perfect for two people to share the wait staff was pleasant and wellinformed i look forward to returning to toast in the near future
awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options the meatloaf  which is currently standard  was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty the dessert  the girl scout trio consisting of their take on samoas  tagalongs  and thin mints  was  well  orgasmic the waitress  roxanne  whom i told did not have to put on her red dress  was sweet and not overly attentive oh  and its byob i will definitely be back
just incredible pastries  the breads obviously have an amazing amount of attention paid to them  and it pays off with the most flavorful and fulfilling bites  was in boston for just a weekend and had to come back the second day after falling in love with the sticky buns on the first day  sticky buns  bread on the breakfast sandwiches  cookies  yum
had an amazing  friendly  quiet  cozy  fresh dinner here  very much looking forward to coming again but after going once ill say its one of the best places ive been in pittsburgh  daily menu is limited and written on a chalk board above the dining room  looking forward to getting to know this place  byob is a plus servers are friendly and attentive
a decent ramen joint in university city and they have vegan ramen with vegan broth im sold  since ive been a vegetarian my entire life  ive always been envious of all my friends who get to slurp down ramen its been one of my biggest foodie dreams to finally have a bowl of ramen someday  and ramen bar has provided me with that  my 4 friends and i decided to go to ramen bar on a thursday night around 730pm it was packed fortunately  though  we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated at the clean  wooden tables a notable feature abour ramen bar is the open kitchen you pass by  where you can see everything the chefs are doing you can see that theyre actually making everything from scratch  in a very clean setting  so thats reassuring  since the restaurant is so new  the waitstaff are a bit flustered  but theyre extremely friendly and willing to do anything to accomodate the guests when we were ordering  my friend and i both ordered veggie ramen  and she made sure to ask if we wanted the vegetarian broth with traces of pork or have freshly made vegan broth at no additional charge awesome she also gave our table great recommendations on toppings  and our water was filled fairly regularly  it took about 20 minutes for our ramen to come out  which was impressive for how crowded the restaurant was i ordered a veggie shoyu ramen with curly noodles and was extremely impressed by the beautiful presentation and aroma of the dish the taste was even better obviously  i am no ramen snob  and have nothing to compare this ramen to  but aaaahhh finally having veg ramen for the first time in my life to me  the dish was excellent the addition of sriracha just made it better all of my friends were really impressed as well  and we had quite a jovial time i tried my friends veggie miso ramen with straight noodles  and it was amazing too  the only downside was that my friend ordered a 2nd order of noodles 2  but they didnt come in time  since theyre prepared from scratch however  the kind waitress packed it togo for him  as well as gave him more complimentary broth  which was appreciated also  8 to 12 for a bowl of ramen is steep  but not steep enough to keep me away from coming back every time my wallet can afford it  moral of the story im not sure how good this ramen is for omnivorous ramen snobs  but if youre a vegetarianvegan dying to finally try ramen  this is the place
sniff  i cant believe this day has actually come  rip buck fiddy  you will be missed
four stars for the food one star as a tip to the cook for never once wincing at the ready to erupt volcano of food in my bowl before it gets plopped on the grill  score two full days of food to add to the freshman fifteen   this place still holds a dear spot in my heart simply because it helped me feed my way through college the perfect meal was a night at mongols with a platter of meat  veggies  carbs  and lots of them not to mention glorious sauces glistening down my chin as i shoveled noodles into my gaping jaw keep going until youre full up to your chin  take the rest home and repeat in 24 hours thats the only way to do it  kids   i will still happily return to mongols at a moments notice i probably dont need to be as hasty with the volcanobowl save some for the hungry college kids cause im generous and all  but i will need a bib
one of the ultimate questions in life has to be snickerdoodle or white choc macadamia chocolate chip or mm cookies and milk or ice cream sammy two or two dozen oh god  now what flavor of ice cream do i want a hot dog too do i really need these 900 calories   answer yes all of it for a dollar and change  what the hell else do you want  one day i hope to die by snickerdoodle overload
enzos is probably the best pizza ive ever had they are open til really late on the weekends perfect for a 2am meal  and much better than taco bell which is across the street it has an italian mafia theme to it with pictures of frank sinatra and scenes from the godfather hanging on the walls not only do they have the best pizza in westwood  but they also have the biggest one time i ordered a massive 23 inch pizza that thing was a monster  enzos gets 5 stars for having the best pizza  prices  service  and ambience i recommend it to anyone in the westwood area who is hungry at 2am
rip fake sub we call it fake sub cuz it was like subway  but fake lol  so many memories at this place  sad to see you go 
i love going to the backyard its just perfect for a sunday afternoon the backyard burger is one of my favorite burgers in la this place is a little pricey but totally worth it you can sit by the pool and relax with some good food  great drinks  and sometimes they play house music i wish they would lower the prices a bit then it would be perfect
best boba in westwood
rip pastrami sandwich with extra meat no cucumbers  tear
oh  mr luthe mystery of how yummy one burger can be is easily answered at this bright orange  funky decorated establishment  i have tried several of the burgers and never been disappointed among my favorite are bbq  blu cheese  and cajun i like to order the veggie with the cajun sauce its a bit spicy but a great addition to a burger that would be bland  the man who i always see there i am going to assume is mr lu   is always more than kind and friendly prices are reasonable  bit more than fast food  but much fresher also  with a punch card its pretty easy to acquire a free burger the fries are perfectly seasoned and flavorful  the fry sauce is a must  by the end of the meal 2 containers can easily be dominated by one person   hours are decent as well  i think theyre open until 10 or 11 on weekdays  take the walk across the street from jack in the box or memos  you will be delightfully surprised
ok  you guys i love waffles i love sandwiches  so what coule be better than a  waffle sandwich oh yeah  pretty much nothing  madeleines serves a sandwich made with a fluffy waffle for bread it had an overmedium egg  ham  and a yummy tangy sauce that blended the sweetness of the waffle and the savory of the ham perfectly also noteworthy  it was made to order and hot when served  my boyfriend ordered the breakfast panini  which i snagged a bite of and it was very flavorful it had an egg  bacon  pickles  and another flavorful sauce it too was made to order and was hot and crispy  not at all greasy or soggy  both of us were very pleased and completely finished our sandwiches the staff were very welcoming and quick to prepare our food and coffee on another occasion  ive had one of their sweet cream filled pastries  and it was very light and airy  sweet and pretty cheap i think one dollar  all in all  i will definitely be back to this cute place
absolutely the best place to have an asian style lunch free wifi and good music the owner likes classical music i like it too   their food  oh my god  check my pictures out chicken katsu don  shrimp tempura don  curry chicken rice bow all around 8 bucks and comes with purple rice i just love it  this place is super worthy to dine in   updated 080812 recent review by yelp user chris j about they dont make their own bakery is a false statement  they make their bakery i witness it every single day try their twicebaked almond croissant then tell me your comments again  to chris  reviews can easily harm lots of considerate  hardtrying small businesses please review with truth  not guesses or conjectures
oh my god this is the best place to have breakfast sick of starbucks slow service on 42nd come here im sick of lining at starbucks every morning i think you are too  if you are a husky   come here i think you will be satisfied
jesus  i love this place   if you havent had it try the dagwood roast beef  ham  turkey all cooked up on a flat iron grille and stuffed in a pita with fresh veggies what in the hell is not to like people have you checked out the nutrition facts on this place its healthier than subway for christ sake   360 calories for my favorite pita that fills me all the way up till the next meal all the complaints about this place are bullsheet you dont like it then you shouldnt be in the u dist crack heads  hookers  whores  bums  reeeaaallll chhhhaaannnggeeee  it all comes with the territory   i love the pita pit i might franchise one of these
also very sad about the closing of this place i had been coming here since 2000  which my gf  now my wife we were driving through the u dist and were hungary and decided to stop in to relive our college days with some of the best teriyaki in seattle to our display the place has changed names  owners  decors  and menu we ordered anywaybig mistake the food was a huge downgrade the place that is there now is called thunder burger  teriyaki i should have known better i will be giving the thunder burger its own review rip kyoto teriyaki  you will be missed
fiesta cafe has the best mexican in champaignurbana everything isnt made with the same ground beef  there are choices ordered a beef taco and had 4 choices of beef from ground to a chipotle marinade on a nice night  outdoor seating is fun great mexican beer selection and drink specials occur
cant argue with anything anyone else has said   watch out for google latitude directions  you end up catty corner from where your suppose to be   the chrizo nacho cheese was fantastic
the best restaurant in the area hands down i travel all  and have a job which takes me out with clients often finally clairemont has a place which rivals other places in areas like pasadena  downtown  the oc or the westside  interesting menu  the waygu beef is awesome this place is good for brunch as wellfor those who dont like it the prices yeah its not cheap  if you want  cheap and predictable  try all the bland chain restaurants near the mall
the best of all the restaurants  my fav loved it huge portions  tasty lovely  the waiters were great  the food was tasty  cheap i paid around  21 plus 5 for the waitress we had  who was nice this was the second time we went there i had a greek dish the first time the second time i had a greek omelete breakfast plus french toast i loved the food would definitely go there againyummy
yes value for money and the food was tastyyyits a mixture of american and continental food  i had  shrimp salad and a sandwich  huge portion and cheap nice ambience  waiter was moody  but the food made up for it and the portion was huge  huge  huge paid around 25 including tip  will definitely go there againyummy
bella pita is awesome  i usually order the bruin combo which includes a falafel pita  fries and a drink  all three items come for about 78 bucks which is a good deal nowadays  the pita is great because of the customization ability with the vegetable bar  the fries are okay  nothing special but also nothing horrible  i try to stay away from soda but when a place offers coke cola made by real cane sugar  i just have to have it   first time i went here the owner was taking the orders and he made the place feel very welcoming   overall a 5 star place for the great food  nice people and the sugar cane coke  ill probably get my order delivered next time
this place has been around seemingly forever and little has changed  i hope it always endures that way  hawaiian food thats pretty great  portioned for islander appetites  and priced for college students  what more could you ask for  the picture menu on the wall has not changed much since i was hanging around the ave as a student at uw  the choices are plentiful and the staff has always been friendly  im surprised i didnt review this place before because i still recommend it to friends  dont forget that its cash only  or you might be forced to use the atm in the shop and i dont know what that thing charges  but i bet its closer to something than nothing  always great
the cedars restaurant has always been my goto place for indian in seattle  its been at the top of my indian list for years and i love the place  i do love the food here immensely  the butter chicken is fantastic  the nan is usually quite a portion and we always order a couple  plain and garlic  my fave dish  though  is the coconut curry with chicken  yumo  the chai here is also pretty freakin fantastic and theyll keep filling it for you all night long unless its a packed house  i love the baklava that they bring out with the bill  this place is a good place for a casual  yet still nice date or for groups  on the unfortunate side  when it is packed is a terrible time to go  i mean terrible  its not that the food goes down in quality  but you can be sitting around waiting for more service for a long time  its understandable and it can get ridiculously busy  especially on a friday evening  but it can be aggrevating if you arent interested in waiting for the food  i always think its worth the wait  but still try to avoid rush hour  unfortunately  theyve missed the baklava that used to always be brought out with the bill a couple of times in the more recent history  unfortunate especially because its a great ending  we just had to order it then  lastly  and also quite unfortunate  is the parking situation  ever since that walgreens moved in next to it  the cedars parking has been pushed across the street to safeways lot and there is little available parking there  if youre lucky youll find a spot in there or right on brooklyn  but if youre smart youll walk or bus over
howzit  its awesome  thats how it is  i had never heard of pams until i read about it from nina n i love food from the west indies and pams is somewhere that will make me forgo many of the other locations in seattleits really that good  i had lamb roti potatoes and lamb  spiced  curried  and put into a piece of rotithink tortilla  but more pliable  and quite a bit tastier served on the side was a cabbage  not shredded lettuce  salad to drink  i had some rum punchmmmm mmmmmi think it was spiced with ginger and to top it off  i was asked if i wanted some hot sauce feeling saucy  i accepted  good lord their hot sauce is hot its habenero mixed with something its got the consistency of applesauce  its dully yellow in color and its hotter than the coals found in hell  or at least thats where they found this stuff be cautioustalk about kicking it up a notchit kicked my arse up a couple of floors  the service and atmosphere nicely accompany the decadent cuisine here as trinidadiantoboggan music bumps  youll be catered to by the attentive staff  do i recommend pams do you like all your toes
best pupusas ever well  at least this side of the border guanacos serves absolutely authentic salvadoran cuisine  the pupusas especially the veggie and the pork tacos being my favorites pretty much everything here is amazing even just the rice and beans just have a little something special in them plus  this is the kind of local business that seattleites need to support the owner is officially one of the nicest guys ever and always greets me and my company warmly oh  yes  the prices are great as well it doesnt look fancy from the outside  or the inside for that matter  but the food is fabulous and by far surpasses the pretensions of somewhere like la isla not that i am not a fan just too expensive to frequent i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i swear if i have anything to do with it  they are going to be the next big seattle food craze  as long  of course  as business is still booming here  its all good the guac i am not so fond of  but hey  where else can you get a side of guac for 75 cents no where  thats where love guanacos  support guanacos perhaps someday ill be granted the masa dough recipe gooooooooooooaaaaaallllllll
edit i love hoppy beers now took me long enough big time gets a big time upgrade from 4 to 5  now that i realize each and every one of their brews is gold   so its a saturday night  and you find yourself on the ave at a bar so crowded that it takes 5 minutes to get a drink  and when you finally get to the bartender  you have to shout at them over the blaring top 40 music just so they can hear your order you think  what the fuck am i doing here i just want to enjoy a few beers with some friends that i can actually talk to without shouting at then you suddenly remember that brewpub down the street in the quaint little brick building  and you realize that all hope is not lost   on any given night  there will usually be a few tables open where one can enjoy good beer  good food  and have a good conversation with good music pearl jam  pixies  ccr  etc playing at a decent level in the background   im pretty much in love with their sandwiches particularly the cascade and pink cadillac also to be had are very tasty pizza slices  chili  and most everything else on the menu   as for the alcohol  theres only beer lots and lots of craftbrewed beer  which thankfully drives away the i just wanna dance and drink vodkaredbulls crowd im not a huge fan of ipas  or really hoppy beers in general which several of their brews are however  they do have an excellent porter and a delicious brown ale   looking for bud light mixed drinks a dance floor loud pop music trendy and hip decor thankfully  you wont find any of that here
jumbo lamb and beef gyro for 5 really  this is all that matters ive been here for lunch  dinner  and most frequently at 1 am after leaving big time or finn mccools no matter what time of day  the service is always fast and the gyros are always delicious and filling cash only shouldnt be a problem  as there are both wells fargo and boa atms within a block and a half of this place
ive been eating at 35 at least once a month since i moved to chapel hill five years ago  dont go there if you are expecting exotic or authentic chinese food  because their offerings are very americanized  but if you have a palate like my little brothers  who considers panda express to be the definition of great chinese food  you will love this place  my favorite items on the buffet are pan fried dumplings  these are juicy  tasty and totally awesome  i usually load up my plate with them if they have just been refreshed by the kitchen staff  my second favorite dish is the eggplant dish  it doesnt look like much  but try it if you like eggplants  i love that stuff  it tastes just like my grandmothers  i also like the salt and pepper shrimp  though it takes a bit of work to peel them  theres a good variety  ranging from the typical orangesesamesweet  sour chicken  broccoli beef to fried salmon and steamed flounder  they also have a variety of little steamed chinese dim sum  theres a nice fresh fruit and dessert section  with a candy bar for your soft serve ice cream  i also like their egg drop soup  which they bring out to you with your drink order    overall  i love this place and will continue to go there on a regular basis as long as i live in chapel hill  its not pf chang  so dont go there expecting that sort of service  but it is a great chinese buffet in a college town that will fill belly for a very reasonable price
ridiculously positive and plentiful reviews for a reason fresh  fast  delicious and reasonably priced some of the best falafel  if not the best ive ever had
i come here mainly for the veggie delight and whenever i feel guilty from eating too much junk food over the days the food here is extremely healthy trust me i know since i was briefly obsessed with nutritionfitness for a period of my life the amount of salad you get is obscenely large  a good deal for the price and i swear to god that i just feel better after eating their food you almost always have portions left over so you can eat it for lunch the day after  which is awesome because it means you dont have to cook very important for a college student
one of the many reasons why i moved from nyc to oakland  this place is sublime at 2am  nights are judged as top dog nights or nontop dog nights    a top dog night is a night that lasts a lifetime or at least till the next weekend  favorites hot or a bird w chili  remember to be patient
its like the max and the peach pit for boalties damnit im outing myself
the vegetarian pad see ew wegg here is my favorite thai dish anywhere that it comes from a little momnpop getup makes it even better
best felafel i have had in long long time  possibly ever  and they have a little salad bar from which you pick your favorite garnishments for your sandwich loved that they also had eggplants my absolute favorite vegetable
after spending far too long in the doughnut deprived northeast please dont give me that nonsense about dunkin donuts tasting like anything better than cardboard  finding stans right down the street was like winning the lottery  first  the litmus test chocolatecovered old fashion  honestly  delicious  not as crispy on the outside as i like  but great chocolate and spot on softonthe inside doughnut  second  ohtheplacesyoullgo  ever dreamed of some ridiculous filling in a doughnut  they have it  blueberry oldfashionamazing  peanut butter and jelly doughnutheart attack of flavor  in short  if you want to become a diabetic  try this place  because one is just not enough and nowhere else around will do
this is a great store  went to college nearby  even though i live in north jersey now  im still a bottle club member  amazing selection and great prices  this is the only place you need to for beer  wine or liquor  i think theyre improved customer service and id checking  back in college they had guys at the front door  counter and exit  now they seem to operate like everybody else  iding as necessary but usually just the counter  give this place a try
im in love with teriyaki boy there i said it  ive been going here since college and it my absolute favorite bangforthebuck place  chicken teriyaki with spicy tuna roll and green tea  i dont even have to order it anymore  they remember  even though i only come in once every few months now i moved away but will go here whenever close  dont let the odd location fool you  this is the perfect lunch
uh  if you rated this place lower than five stars you are fucking crazy  its a warehouse a warehouse filled with booze all kinds of boozewine  liquor  beer  crazy shit ive never heard of  etc everything is cheap they have a gigantic selectionsee warehouse many employees to help you with your selection ive been here an embarrassing number of times  im really not sure what else you need in a liquor store
best place on earth i grew up in the area and ive eaten a number 1 with everything on it sometimes a number 3 with everything more times than you could possibly imagine interspersing these number 3s and 1s were many a cheeseburger  cheesesteak and sanchez forget that footlong horseshit you can get something thats at least two feet long here for around 5  its better than whatever sandwich place you go to except maybe georges
when it comes to sandwiches  im very  very simple simple like i only like my sandwiches with the bread and meat this place is perfect for people like me of course you can add more if you like  but if you prefer just two ingredients like me  they sure pack enough to make up for the other missing ones   very simple concept you go in  check off the items you want on a brown paper bag and hand it to the cashier this place is known for their bread never fails to be big  fluffy  and soft all at the same time definitely not able to find any other sandwich joint that has jalapeno cheddar bread like theirs   they pack their sandwiches with lots of meat so much that i really dont know how to start off the first bite half a sandwich is enough to fill me up i like to get the medium rare roasted beef on wheat bread with extra pickles and lettuce then stuff it with jalapeno kettle chips makes a perfect lunch d
we came here on a recommendation from our close friend who is an admitted food snob  i was told that the chicken parm was really good by the snob  and really i have not had an italian chicken dish that has compared  the chicken had a great crunch to it  but the meat was still incredibly tender  the sauce and pasta with it were amazing    i honestly cant fault this place for anything  the service was fantastic  the ambiance was great  if you want me to try to find a weakness it is in an area that is not convenient for me  and since i rarely pass by there i dont get to go back as often as i would like
this is my favorite beer bar in houston so far  its got a relaxed atmosphere and it isnt a scene  which is a plus in my book  if you like to enjoy a good selection of craft beers while chatting  this is the place to go  the outdoor patio allows you to hear your friends without having to ask them to yell  the location is also fantastic  being so close to rice campus and in a nice neighborhood where i havent had trouble finding street parking yet
ive been here several times and have yet to be disappointed  ive had several different sandwiches and salads and they were all fantastic  ive also heard wonderful things about their banh mi from people that i usually accuse of being banh mipho snobs  you order at a counter  but they bring your food to your table and bus your table for you  the big draw here is the quality of their ingredients  they use fresh  quality ingredients from local farms and i suspect that they bake their own bread  which is delicious  they have unique sides that are fresh  tasty  and possibly healthy how can raw vegetables have so much flavor  the service is also fantastic here    the food here is not cheap  but you get quality as well as quantity  i usually have leftovers  athough not quite enough for a full meal    the ambience of this place is delightful as well  lots of light  space  and modern decor  where you can see the food preparation taking place in a big open space  not only is the food good  but its extremely pleasant to eat here   i would caution about eating outside the tables are underneath a huge tree that offers great shade but many birds  and ive had pigeons poop into my salad
handsdown the best pizzeria in town  owned and run by an italian family better than dominos  papa johns and some of the other places  much better hole in the wall kind of place   but  the pizza and calzones are  very very good
i tend to hate crazes  mostly because the main sentiment is craziness  cherry on top has been a pleasant surprise  though  i work across the street and have ended up going there a few times now  mostly for the tullys coffee they serve mate for all of you tea fiends  and theres nothing better than a sugarcaffeine rush at noon  whilst i was there today  they played a friendly fires song too in the hospital for those of you musically inclined folk  nothing like shakin your bootay while making it bigger  i tend to like a little junk in the trunk  especially my own  ok  i wrote this a while ago  and i have to say that my expectations have been blown away  the owner rocks  the staff is quite friendly  and even when the place is busy they still find the time to help  dont ever leave  cherry on top  i shant ever cheat on you with another
why do people insist on reviewing places based on what theyve read  if thats how the world worked id never leave my apartment  this is yelp  not your mothers house  nobody cares    i tried this place a couple of weeks ago  and it was quite delicious  the frozen yogurt sorry  i cant bring myself to say froyo for fear of violently vomitingits one of the only words that actually makes my insides hurt is really soft and delicious  and like the previous snob noted  wont give you lovehandles or diabetes  i dont go to confession after eating frozen yogurt without mochi  so im ok with the plethora of other wonderful items they have    the waffles are pretty damn awesome too  and  if you actually look at the sign which reads fresh fruit salads and hot dogs  its not primarily a frozen yogurt place  and its colombian    if youre in pasadena and want to try some tasty waffles  hot dogs  or frozen yogurt or go for all three  i dont judge  tutti frutti is your place  its not pinkberry  which is always a good thing when youre not in the mood for overdressedtrustfundhannahmontanalookalikes      id give it four stars  but the first review is so ridiculous i bumped it up a star
fast  cheap  tasty  just as described
great food truck  delicious burgers and josh and team are very friendly  the specials are the real treat though  whether its filet mignon sandwiches  thai fish soup  or lobster rolls  dont ask questions  just order the special and enjoy
very good  very large sandwich
great new food truck  get on their email list to follow them since they are not on twitter  have had the banh mi  the chicken pita  and the dry aged burger and all three were very good  i think  the greek style chicken pita on the homemade grilled pita is my favorite  very glad these guys set up shop so close to the office
the following items on the menu are the worlds best microbrewed beer  nachos  bread  olive oil  fish  chips  i stumbled upon it with my dad during my freshman year of college  and i was blown away by the food  and once i was able to drink legally it became my hangout for the remainder of college  perfect place to bring out of town visitors  dark  cozy  intelligent  its true boston
crushes pinkberry  red mangos original yogurt is sweeter and tastes much much better with fruits  with anything  than pinkberrys tart mediocre yogurt
the best thing ive ever had in my entire life  and so cheap  and so simple that i find it hard to describe it to friends and family back east  amazing  and i wonder why there arent carbon copies opening left and right  as is the case with pinkberry
came here for sunday brunch buffet with my usc friend  im new to indian food and the thought of being able to try several different dishes made me so excited i wanted to poop  its a tiny  intimate  no frills place with flatscreen tvs showing indian music videos and we were greeted by this lady in a sara who gave us the warmest  most attentive  grandmotherly greeting of my life  better than my own mothers after i got back from iraq i didnt really go to iraq    she brings you water and a basket of naan you can choose between regular or garlic garlic  then you grab a plate and dig into one of sixteen different dishes chicken and tofu curries  palak paneer  mushroom curry  jasmine rice and yellow rice with peas  items from the salad bar like yogurt w carrots and cucumbers  vanilla custard wfruit  mint or tamarind chutney  and for dessert drum roll gulab jamon  a crazy sweet doughnut soaked in more sugar  all for 9  the cost of brunch  then i pooped
what the fuck  closed  well  i can cross that off my list when i visit home  this was the secondbest brunch place that doubled as an amazing bar at night in boston  after soundbites in somerville  shiiiiiiit  rip  bside
the last review i read is correct  sooooooooooo much creamier and less tart than pinkberry  im a fan and will most likely not be going to pinkberry provided that more red mangos open up  i had a medium plain with strawberries  raspberries and carob chips  delightful    theres even a cool loungetype area to hang out in if you get there early enough to snag it  yum yum and yum
delightful  delightful i cant believe its only 160 calories but i highly recommend this spot  my friend had the pomegranate which was tasty and i had the donnatella versace and something else  cappuccino and cookies  go and get 2 scoops
i ordered the don its a pretty good sandwich  and its averagely priced  i love how they shave the cabbage to thin pieces its easier to eat it that way
the best fro yo in la their fro yo is very natural fructose free
love at first bite my girlfriend introduced me to this place two years ago and i am still in love with their carne asada burrito my friends and i hit this place up at least once a month its cheap  fast  and good it tastes very authentic it doesnt taste americanized i have also had their chile relleno once before it was good but i still love their carne asada burritos more  i dont think i could handle their carne asada fries just looking at them makes my blood pressure shoot up
the cheapest oooorgasmic experience in los angeles diddy riese contributed to my freshman 15  but every single time i ran  i lived in westwood  to diddy i left with a smile my favorite diddy is vanilla ice cream between a peanut butter and sugar cookie it has never disappointed me theres always lines outside  but be patient and you will get your diddygasm its the cheapest dessert in westwood only 150
i thought shops like this doesnt exist anymore because these days desserts like these are overpriced and over sweet   delicious cookies 3 for 1   ice cream sandwich for 150   open late hours  basic  simple delicious cookies and ice cream   my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nuts cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream mmmmmm   this place will knock your sweet tooth off and will definitely win you over then any overpriced ice cream sandwich food trucks  or overpriced mrs  somebody cookies shop ps the only negatives are cash only  and parking
if i had gone to ucla for undergrad  it would have been freshmen 35 at least with diddy riese right around the corner    bad breakup    hot summer night   study break    all perfect occasions for a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two warm cookies   for 150  i am glad i live far away enough that i can only get it once every couple of years
the best pizza ive ever had was in new york cant remember the name and in boston a place in the north end it turns out that the bostonian place was owned and run by the grandmother of the fellow who owns and runs damores pizza a mini chain in la somehow he manages to create an absurdly great pizza with insanely low amounts of fat and calories  compared to slop and crap giants like pizza hut  dominos  etc this guys pizza was rated as the number one pizza in the country by another ratings site that i shant mention here on yelp  why lemme tell ya incredibly thin  incredibly crisp crust that has leagues of flavor in it  along with massively high quality ingredients quite simply  the tastetexture combination is superior to any pizza ive had in la  and i am an immense pizza snob you have to like this particular style  of course if you prefer soggy  spongy  greasy spoons like the aforementioned pizza behemoths  you will be sorely disappointed ah well  your loss  i spoke with the owner  who was at the front serving customers  and discovered a place where the workers are friendly in that east coast kinda way hell  i actually found myself talking to other customers thats right  los angeles  talking to other people the vibe and decor are perfect and inviting   i worry that if he continues to expand  then the quality will go down  but based on my one experience here  damores will be my first choice for pizza when i have the urge i cant speak for his other locations  but the one in westwood is primo youll pay for it  he imports the water from boston  and you cant make a great a great pizza with cheap ingredients im wiling to fork out the extra dough to eat a pizza that had me blabbing and smiling about it all night long to my girlfriend yep  it was that good
i love this place the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is always inviting their grilled vegetable salad is to this day the best ive ever had and ive had a lot of them  i love that they serve breakfast all day and i had one incredible egg white veggie omelette i have no idea what it was about it  but it was one of the most flavorful and delicious omelettes ive ever had i can almost taste it nowoh sweet goodness plus  i love supporting a small business  something about that just makes the saladomelette even better
this is the best chinese food in ann arbor  my favorite thing there is the chicken in pineapple nest  fantastic  the service is also topnotch  friendly and fast  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is really nice too  i highly recommend it
they now have chicken curry pasties if you have an idea for a pasty  let them know  fantastic people brilliant in every way i will drive 100 miles here every couple of weeks just to stock up in their deliciousness
their homemade salsa and chips you get free with your meal is so freaking good i always go through 2 baskets good guac too big portions  fresh ingredients  not greasy and you can see your food being made a big plus for me when eating mexican i guess its nothing special  but they dont seem to do anything wrong which for the price is way 5 stars blows taco roca and baja fresh away in my opinion staff is always friendly good outdoor seating for people watching
best thai in slo good atmosphere if you want it spicy you really have to convince them if you order medium spicy it will taste like what you would get if you ordered mild in a big city thai place  get the pineapple fried rice and the pad ke mow you wont be disappointed the waiters always seem kind of shy and unconfident but they get the job done
keep is simple and get the gyro plate fresh made hummas and pita im not a fan of the schwarma  but maybe thats just me i dont really get the petrajaffa thing it seems like the same food to me petra has a little bit better atmosphere except dont eat downstairs but it takes longer to get your food
