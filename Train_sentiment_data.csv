my first visit was a few days ago  but never the less  as i remember the soft savory deliciousness of my lamb shank  the couscous raining down my throat and the bouquet of roses that blossomed in my mouth with every sip of my lemonade  i drool im really starting to salivate now and need to push my key board out of drools way   the appetizer portions are for one person strange  i know  so dont go into getting an appetizer thinking youll share with a friend   the neighborhood is quiet and the restaurant is cozy  staff is very pleasant  and i am officially a fan  terrifically tasty tunisian treats for the tummy,positive
i dont know why anyone eats ice cream anymore,positive
im not a vegetarian or vegan  so when this place was recommended to me  i was skeptical i decided to try it  though  and it is so delicious i have been here a bunch recently and i havent had a bad dish  to order here  you choose one of three pizza dough  brown rice  or coconut rice and an entree to go on top they have daily specials which are delicious and soups of the week i just recently had tomato and lentil soup which was delicious  also  it is a small space and is part of a music club  club passim you will be asked upon entering if youre there for the show or for dinner you may have to wait for a table  especially if you have 4 people  and takeout is always a fast  delicious option also  before 4 or 5pm  there are no waiters  so you just place your order through a window to the cook  it is a little hard to find  take a look at the pictures on yelp its a basement and connected to club passim  so if youre going here at night  you may hear music from the club just follow that and youll figure it out  they also have 2 beers on tap and desserts,positive
sensational  an adult cupcake with oozyfilling  buttercream frosting was to die for  at last nights victory party  i ate a yummy meyer lemon cupcake  a coffeeflavored one  and a chocolate one    im not usually a cupcake fanatic  but these were delicious f,positive
i just went last week the restaurant gets 5 stars because the staff is excellent friendly  knowledgeable  the food is superb  and the ambiance is great  one warning i went expecting real southern food i went with my mother  from texas  and father  from virginia  and told them it was southern it is not traditional southern  but still delicious my mom and dad both said it was great  just not real southern  i had the catfish  my mom had the chicken  my dad had the pork i loved the catfish  and my parents loved their dishes for desert  we had the peach melba that was the most delicious desert i can remember having if you go  get the melba its seasonal so get it while it lasts,positive
this place is great they have a lot of cocktails  so you can go here plenty of times without having to drink the same drink twice  and they are all great they also have good beer and a pretty big wine list  though ive never had wine here  the food looks amazing  but i havent had dinner here yet i have had the chips and dip  though both the chips and the dip are homemade and so amazingly delicious  i wont look at chips the same way again  sundays are stout  oyster night  where with every stout you get  you also get a free oyster i love sundays here wednesdays are mexicantheme and they have a whole list of cocktails made with tequila they also have a mexicantheme snack list for wednesdays both nights are fun and delicious  the atmosphere is maybe the best part  for me green street has a cozy  intimate feeling while still having a chic feel the music is usually soul and funk  which i love  but there are other styles mixed in  the staff is friendly  and good at their jobs  if youre having a hard time finding the place  youre not alone it looks sketchy from the outside  but is amazing on the inside the best advise i have is to look at the pictures on yelp if you take a look at them  youll have a much easier time finding it,positive
being so far away from pinkberry makes me a little sad  but now theres the bigger and better berry line a mere hour away in nearby boston though i wouldnt trek it just for froyo would i  tasting that good and still low fat is a beautiful thing regular flavor never gets old its smoother and creamier than pinkberry and definitely less tart  which is why berry line trumps pinkberry now i can add pineapple topping without my glands going wild  topping choices include your cereals  fruits  and chocolates personal fav fruity pebbles  banana  and mochi inside is quaint and cute as a button makes you want to sit and talk about happy thoughts,positive
any visit to central will almost guarantee a visit to miracle partly because my friend works here  but morely because i just frickin love the vibe  the black top tables remind me of my chemistry labs everytime i walk in my eyes divert directly to that triangle table in the middle my mind runs and i picture myself having one too many beers  stumbling  and whacking my head right on the pointy part ha ha  anyways beers keep flowing  staff is laidback burgers jumbo  juicy steakeggs and very importantly their veggie burgers are the best ive ever tasted in my entire existence probably has a lot to do with the sauce its incredibly great,positive
go with the sicilian pan  weve been eating here for years and it never disappoints  be ready to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a pizza  but its worth it  beer prices are not bad and service was great,positive
i would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice the naan is really great too i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer  as well as the samosas i am not an expert on indian food so i cant tell you how authentic it is  but i can tell you that it is delicious,positive
i had a great experience at golden harbor i would recommend going with a group of people because the entrees are rather large we ordered 6 entrees for 8 people  but i think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it  my favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken  the crispy tofu  and the pork buns the basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful the crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that i really enjoyed we assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat  a container of buns  and a plate of garnishes crushed peanuts  some sort of veggies  and cilantro the menu is very extensive  so be prepared to spend some time looking through it though you really cant go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu   when you arrive at the restaurant  you take a table number  menu  and ordering slip to a table of your choice then after you decide what you want  you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay it works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because im not sure that they allow separate checks from one table then someone will bring your food to your table tea is free  and you can simply serve yourself at the end of your meal you clear your own dishes  or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you,positive
papa dels is my favorite pizza restaurant  and definitely worth the wait for delivery  ive experienced it taking everywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to arrive  but id say it is most often 4560 minutes if you are planning to dine in at the restaurant  i would recommend calling the restaurant about 20 minutes before you plan to be there to preorder your pizza this significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant take out is the fastest option my pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order  the deep dish pan pizza is their specialty the toppings are always fresh and delicious i order garlic on every pizza i get from papa dels because it is just so fresh and delicious im not a big sausage fan  but i enjoy theirs very much my favorite combination of toppings to get is garlic  sausage  black olives  and green peppers yum,positive
delicious  delicious barbecue i didnt even know that i liked barbecue until i ate at black dog for the first time i recommend any of the sandwiches  and the spicy southwest potato salad is spicy and wonderful the corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside very filling and rich and tasty  you will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small ive heard that ordering takeout works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat  but i havent tried it yet the waitstaff are always friendly  though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food,positive
i love this place they have some very unique sushi but they also have some boring ones so long as you order right  the sushi is amazing i recommend the flaming red dragon  i think that is what it was called the stir fry is also superb service is great also,positive

this place is easily one of my favorite places to eat  and you will quickly learn im not a stickler for fancy dining  i just like good food   fiesta prepares their burritos as close to homemade as i have found  they make their own tortillas and sauces  as well as having a variety of fresh accompaniments to top or stuff in your food  ive heard the tacos and quesadillas are good  but i order a burrito every single time i come here  why mess with something so good  they let you choose your choice of fillings including rice  two types of beans  and multiple meats including a great grilled steak or roasted pork  then you can choose to have your burrito enchilada style  and let me say right now  do that  they top it with a sauce of your choice green tomatillo  green chile  or red chile  sprinkle it with cheese  and bake it  then you can add salsa  sour cream and a few other sides if you wish  this place has become somewhat of an obsession at work  with fiesta trips happening every other week  the food is outstanding  the grilled steak burrito is my current favorite  with green chile sauce on top  which adds just the right amount of spice and lends great flavor  if you live in lafayette and have not visited here  you are truly missing out,positive
best mexican food in town  its located in small grocery store my kind of place and not only sells great things  but makes delicious food  i grew up near mexico  and this is as close to authentic that i have gotten in the area  the salsa is fresh  the sauces always taste just slightly different because they are made fresh every day  and the whole meal is always fantastic  the service is good and friendly  and their green enchiladas are awesome  they are working on expanding and adding another location i believe but they also do delivery and carryout,positive
we dined at maza last night for the first time since they relocated  im very happy we made a reservation  as they had a wait otherwise  the decor is nice  and the place is small without being too tight   service was also quite good  we ordered a bottle of lebanese wine  which was fantastic   you can either get all tapas style appetizers or enjoy one of their entrees  they locally source their meat  which i really appreciate  had the sambousek for an appetizer which was quite light and good  my wife had the armenian chicken  which came with peppers and rice and was outstanding  its a simple dish and was perfectly seasoned  i had the lamb shank with potatoes and rice which was also wonderful  i appreciate the food is simple  not smothered in sauces  and very well cooked  overall a great meal  and my new favorite upscale restaurant in the area,positive

authentic mexican food in the middle of a bustling mexican grocery store sits la guadalupana  one of west lafayettes best kept secrets   please try something that you wouldnt normally order the tongue tacos are fantastic  as well as the menudo you can tell this has been made by a family adhering to the quality they would make for their family the food takes a while because its made to order  so make time to wait    the grocery is stoked with awesome imported foods and a wide selection of beautifully kitschy prayer candles,positive
flippin fantastic  our dinner here last week was definitely 5 star quality  the wine  steak  sides and service were all top notch  i liked the atmosphere a lot too  it wasnt too dark and even though the place was packed for a wednesday night you feel the isolation within your area  im a booth girl  so was a bit disappointed the only booths available were by the kitchen  so we opted for a table  if youd like a booth in a nice area  mention this when making reservations  they have tons of wine to choose from  the waiter was given free reign to choose from a white for us and he did an excellent job  i love the smaller entree selection  there are only three options  but i got the filet and the scalloped potatoes and it was the perfect size  as another reviewer mentioned  the service was great  but not overbearing  they give you plenty of time to finish your bottle and chat and leave at your own pace,positive
five stars for some of the best pearls ive tasted in the bay area  theyre soft  chewy  and theyre not too sweet  plus  at 150 for a green tea with pearls  its a steal  id definitely come here more often if i lived in berkeley and not san jose  p,positive
boy oh boy  were my taste buds in for a treat after being warmly greeted by the coownerhostessipoddj  we started with poached pears baked in raw honey with roquefort and drizzled with balsamic dressing and complemented by wine from nextdoor  byob and no corkage how deliciously affordable the other owner  her husband  stopped by our table to chat us up  he has managed nightclubs and restaurants in nyc for the better part of 15 years and is a charismatic whirlwind but back to the food  my friend went with the forest mushroom ragout stewed with tofu  carrots  spicy sprouts and caribbean beans  while i opted for free range chicken breast marinated in lime jus and jerk spices with chevre and papaya puree so tender  moist  and dripping with taste that sounded dirty  didnt it but im talking about some damn good cooking and the portions so generous even little miss piggy here couldnt finish her supper when it came to dessert however  this little piggy had none,positive
before i found cheese n stuff  i ate top ramen then i told myself no  i will not have that stereotypical college ramen  so i started eating at chipotle yeah  im original you dont have to tell me but thank you anyways  well i was too much a stingy bastard for chipotle so i switched to 3 6inch sandwichs from subway  but deep inside  i was disappointed  like a chain smoker who switched to nicotene patches but one day  one glorious day  i saw a little sign that said cheese n stuff and i wondered wtf is stuff is it wine crackers koala bears well i went in and found out  stuff is cheap  delicious sandwiches made to order from a variety of breads  cheeses  meats  and toppings its also salads that i havent tried but all that matters are the sandwiches seriously  go get one now youre wasting too much time reading this shit,positive
i love the sandwiches here  the honey oat bread is thick and so good  they are huge too  whenever i come to berkeley  i have to eat here conveniently located on telegraph where there is always a huge line out the door  they also have great salads  fresh tossed with fresh ingredients  sometimes they add too much dressing though good cheap prices especially for a starving student at cal  a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner,positive
yum  i ordered the nacho boy from nacho boy  and it was nothing but pure unadulterated deliciousness  roast beef  avocado  shrooms and melted swiss cheese stuffed inside a sourdough roll and made dirty  you gotta get it dirty this is my new favorite sandwich  call in your order or wait a hour in line and another half hour for the sandwich  this ikes place is located inside the engineering building at stanford university  i have also been to the one in sf  this one is closer and just as good but parking was not ideal  metered visitor parking sucks man   i love sandwiches and i love ikes place,positive
i cant comment on the food here but the ice cream is great  i tried the pistachio and it was a huge green scoop on a cake cone  everytime i go to palo alto  i try to make a trip here their ice cream is homemade and delicious  prices are really cheap too  this place is kind of hidden because its in a neighborhood and stands alone  cute old school diner type atmosphere  only open monday through fridays from 7am5pm,positive
i wish there was a wegmans in northern california  this place has everything  i swear  there is a fresh bakery  ready to eat hot foods  pharmacy  fresh produce  video store  amazing meat and cheese selection  dry cleaners and a lot more  this place is like costco except you dont have to buy things in bulk  it is one of my favorite things about the east coast i could come here everyday and find something new to enjoy  prices are normal supermarket prices and food is insanely gourmet  it is also open 24 hours a day for those college students who get the midnight munchies i am counting the days till wegmans comes to california  i will be there with bells on,positive
fresh cookies  soft or crispyyou decide  but either way they are delicious  this time i ordered the turtle and double chocolate chip with its a goody  i enjoyed it except for little bits of hardened toffee from the turtle cookie  but the cookie by itself is awesome  just not meant to be with ice cream unless you have strong teeth or like it really crunchy  its a good was so good    i also got the chocolate milk to go with my ice cream sandwich which was already filled with tons of chocolate  i think i oded on chocolate that dayi couldnt finish my chocolate milk  it was so good  but my body can only handle so much at once  but it was all worth it  im salivating right now just writing this review  ps cash only,positive
ib hoagies was one of my favorite joints at cal  i still go to berkeley just for the curly cheese fries  cheese fries  anything they have cheese on lol  its a college town fast food joint filled with yummy deliciousness  the cheese is the creamy kind not the real melted cheese  its ooey goey cheese sauce that just makes everything taste so good  i prefer coming here over the cheese steak house when i crave for more veggies  i love the sliced lettuce  mayo  tomatoes  pickles  the works  i usually order the chicken philly and its always juicy  it lets me feel a little less guilty for gorging on an order of curly cheese fries on my own lol  i heart ib hoagies ,positive
yay love this place they are open late they accept cash and credit card credit cards they charge a little extra though their portions are huge and their quick super close to cal  so after class i would just hop on over   service its a order and sit down place all the guys working there pretty friendly i never had a problem with it   food the food is awesome for the price  alfredo fettuccine with mushroom  loved it the pasta was al dente  which i loved because most fast place always over cook the pasta  cannoli  yummy it fixes my sugar craving  calzone  super huge but its worth it it can actually be split into two to share or to have for lunch and dinner good breadtoppings ratio   overall i would definitely recommend this place,positive
fine dining  no  good  hearty americanized chinese food  yes  ive always had excellent food and service at china garden  the location next to schnucks is super convenient  easy to stop by on the way home or for a quick run on weekends  i almost always get mine to go  which must be the case for most of their business  food is cooked to order and is super fast about 10 min  portions are large i get two meals from a single order  unlike many chinese restaurants  the flavor of the food isnt overwhelmed by generic seasoning or msg  the egg drop soup the large is a quart has nursed me through many colds and its ridiculously cheap  i appreciate their vegetarian options and theyve always accommodated special requests  their vegetarian spring rolls are gigantic  its chinese fast food  but its fresh  tasty  and a bargain,positive
the ribeye is the best for the greatest steak in town,positive
thanks to big grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients  i went there with my husband for our anniversary  but i can easily see going back for a more casual meal  or even for drinks and bar snacks    every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff  we had the chicken liver pate  bistro filet  house made sausage  and the tater tots  everything we tasted was delicious  i cant wait to go back and work my way through the menu,positive
definitely worth 5 stars  you wont get ambiance  but you will get amazing food,positive
this cafe is wonderful  the atmosphere is bright and cheery  the coffee is wonderful especially the iced soy mocha  and the staff is always super courteous  there is a nice patio in back to enjoy outside seating and there is always great art on the walls,positive
wonderful food and an amazing addition to our community,positive
this is the real deal,positive
i have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly i love trying new things and i am never disappointed  my dad has helped them with a batch of beer  they have made reeses vodka just for my mom and honestly  whenever i go with them to eat its like i walk onto the set of cheers everybody knows their name  but you dont have to be a regular to feel like youre getting special treatment i love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging i love the location  i love the feel i just wish i had more money so i could visit them more often,positive
i really like this place for two reasons  1 the restaurant  bar remind me of legitirish bars that i went to in the nice areas of dublin  the bar and decor are perfect for creating an irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar    2  the food is great  they have a great brunch menu featuring legitirish breakfasts that are the same as the ones ive had in dublin  their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly,positive
this place has great sushi  they have great monday night specials 1 pieces of sushi  3 sake which i love to take advantage of  i really love the big roll  the beef roll  and the dynamite roll  pheonix is an off the menu roll that you can order which comes out on a plate set on fire  mixed drinks are really good there too,positive
two words to describe this joint outstanding bbq  if you eat meat  this is a place you have to try  great ribs  great pork  great brisket  the wait is always really long to get a table cause the food is fantastic  but the space is a bit small for the demand,positive
this place is tiny  which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door  but dont be dissuaded everything ive tried has been fresh and flavorful  and absolutely not drowning in grease which is often my complaint when it comes to mexican food  particularly in the midwest my current favorites are the guacamole  veggie chalupas  and pumpkin flower quesadillla im slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as i return and return again  snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections yum  lately ive been calling for takeout more often because the logistics of getting to maize and finding space are not always easy and so i would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike  car parking bike rack  please but that doesnt seem to be worth knocking off a star  and other than that  i wouldnt want them to change anything,positive
im a mostlyveggie eater  and i love this place their portabello sandwich is among the best ive ever had  apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully the catfish is also delicious love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides i highly recommend the sweet potato fries and  if its summer  the smoked sweet corn yum as most everyone else has said  the meats are also delicious  according to my husband and the tons of people weve brought here for lunch or dinner  their tap list is relatively small  they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time  but theres always lovely choices recently  theres been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin  apple fall beers bar and food service sometimes seems rushed  but surprisingly good for how busy they get  this place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours 30min wait at 830pm on a wednesday  but it has still become our default for outoftown guests that says a whole heck of a lot,positive
best breakfast in cu  the courier breakfast is fantastic  especially with the sausage links  which are essentially english bangers  delicious  when anyone visits town  i make a point to take them to courier because it is such a good representation of what cu has to offer  the coffee selection is almost always great  and service is typically delightful,positive
my friend and i celebrated his birthday here last night and the experience was perfect we were initially given a table very close to a party of four  but they quickly moved us to another table at our request the wine list was pretty broad and we enjoyed a bottle of aligot  a light white wine the bread  which features a different herb daily  was delicious with the butter sweetened with honey the mac  cheese appetizer was excellent  but the risotto was a little salty the butternut squash soup with crme frache was great while the idaho rainbow trout was prepared without much fanfare  it was a welcome change to such places like salt of the earth which drowns many of its dishes in an overabundance of disparate ingredients finally  the milk chocolate pot de crme was pure bliss it wasnt too sweet and perfect for two people to share the wait staff was pleasant and wellinformed i look forward to returning to toast in the near future,positive
awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options the meatloaf  which is currently standard  was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty the dessert  the girl scout trio consisting of their take on samoas  tagalongs  and thin mints  was  well  orgasmic the waitress  roxanne  whom i told did not have to put on her red dress  was sweet and not overly attentive oh  and its byob i will definitely be back,positive
just incredible pastries  the breads obviously have an amazing amount of attention paid to them  and it pays off with the most flavorful and fulfilling bites  was in boston for just a weekend and had to come back the second day after falling in love with the sticky buns on the first day  sticky buns  bread on the breakfast sandwiches  cookies  yum,positive
had an amazing  friendly  quiet  cozy  fresh dinner here  very much looking forward to coming again but after going once ill say its one of the best places ive been in pittsburgh  daily menu is limited and written on a chalk board above the dining room  looking forward to getting to know this place  byob is a plus servers are friendly and attentive,positive
a decent ramen joint in university city and they have vegan ramen with vegan broth im sold  since ive been a vegetarian my entire life  ive always been envious of all my friends who get to slurp down ramen its been one of my biggest foodie dreams to finally have a bowl of ramen someday  and ramen bar has provided me with that  my 4 friends and i decided to go to ramen bar on a thursday night around 730pm it was packed fortunately  though  we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated at the clean  wooden tables a notable feature abour ramen bar is the open kitchen you pass by  where you can see everything the chefs are doing you can see that theyre actually making everything from scratch  in a very clean setting  so thats reassuring  since the restaurant is so new  the waitstaff are a bit flustered  but theyre extremely friendly and willing to do anything to accomodate the guests when we were ordering  my friend and i both ordered veggie ramen  and she made sure to ask if we wanted the vegetarian broth with traces of pork or have freshly made vegan broth at no additional charge awesome she also gave our table great recommendations on toppings  and our water was filled fairly regularly  it took about 20 minutes for our ramen to come out  which was impressive for how crowded the restaurant was i ordered a veggie shoyu ramen with curly noodles and was extremely impressed by the beautiful presentation and aroma of the dish the taste was even better obviously  i am no ramen snob  and have nothing to compare this ramen to  but aaaahhh finally having veg ramen for the first time in my life to me  the dish was excellent the addition of sriracha just made it better all of my friends were really impressed as well  and we had quite a jovial time i tried my friends veggie miso ramen with straight noodles  and it was amazing too  the only downside was that my friend ordered a 2nd order of noodles 2  but they didnt come in time  since theyre prepared from scratch however  the kind waitress packed it togo for him  as well as gave him more complimentary broth  which was appreciated also  8 to 12 for a bowl of ramen is steep  but not steep enough to keep me away from coming back every time my wallet can afford it  moral of the story im not sure how good this ramen is for omnivorous ramen snobs  but if youre a vegetarianvegan dying to finally try ramen  this is the place,positive
sniff  i cant believe this day has actually come  rip buck fiddy  you will be missed,positive
four stars for the food one star as a tip to the cook for never once wincing at the ready to erupt volcano of food in my bowl before it gets plopped on the grill  score two full days of food to add to the freshman fifteen   this place still holds a dear spot in my heart simply because it helped me feed my way through college the perfect meal was a night at mongols with a platter of meat  veggies  carbs  and lots of them not to mention glorious sauces glistening down my chin as i shoveled noodles into my gaping jaw keep going until youre full up to your chin  take the rest home and repeat in 24 hours thats the only way to do it  kids   i will still happily return to mongols at a moments notice i probably dont need to be as hasty with the volcanobowl save some for the hungry college kids cause im generous and all  but i will need a bib,positive

enzos is probably the best pizza ive ever had they are open til really late on the weekends perfect for a 2am meal  and much better than taco bell which is across the street it has an italian mafia theme to it with pictures of frank sinatra and scenes from the godfather hanging on the walls not only do they have the best pizza in westwood  but they also have the biggest one time i ordered a massive 23 inch pizza that thing was a monster  enzos gets 5 stars for having the best pizza  prices  service  and ambience i recommend it to anyone in the westwood area who is hungry at 2am,positive

oh  mr luthe mystery of how yummy one burger can be is easily answered at this bright orange  funky decorated establishment  i have tried several of the burgers and never been disappointed among my favorite are bbq  blu cheese  and cajun i like to order the veggie with the cajun sauce its a bit spicy but a great addition to a burger that would be bland  the man who i always see there i am going to assume is mr lu   is always more than kind and friendly prices are reasonable  bit more than fast food  but much fresher also  with a punch card its pretty easy to acquire a free burger the fries are perfectly seasoned and flavorful  the fry sauce is a must  by the end of the meal 2 containers can easily be dominated by one person   hours are decent as well  i think theyre open until 10 or 11 on weekdays  take the walk across the street from jack in the box or memos  you will be delightfully surprised,positive
ok  you guys i love waffles i love sandwiches  so what coule be better than a  waffle sandwich oh yeah  pretty much nothing  madeleines serves a sandwich made with a fluffy waffle for bread it had an overmedium egg  ham  and a yummy tangy sauce that blended the sweetness of the waffle and the savory of the ham perfectly also noteworthy  it was made to order and hot when served  my boyfriend ordered the breakfast panini  which i snagged a bite of and it was very flavorful it had an egg  bacon  pickles  and another flavorful sauce it too was made to order and was hot and crispy  not at all greasy or soggy  both of us were very pleased and completely finished our sandwiches the staff were very welcoming and quick to prepare our food and coffee on another occasion  ive had one of their sweet cream filled pastries  and it was very light and airy  sweet and pretty cheap i think one dollar  all in all  i will definitely be back to this cute place,positive

also very sad about the closing of this place i had been coming here since 2000  which my gf  now my wife we were driving through the u dist and were hungary and decided to stop in to relive our college days with some of the best teriyaki in seattle to our display the place has changed names  owners  decors  and menu we ordered anywaybig mistake the food was a huge downgrade the place that is there now is called thunder burger  teriyaki i should have known better i will be giving the thunder burger its own review rip kyoto teriyaki  you will be missed,positive
awesome possum assortment of fresh fruits  veggies  meats  cheese  herbs  and more  last time i was there the poppies were poppin with colors to die for  carrboro has such a cool vibe and its great to support local farmers  as a former fruitstand worker with family who owns a blueberry farm in michigan i had high standards  this is definitely worth a weekly trip,positive
med deli  mad deliciousness  their selection and flavorful dishes are to die for  i send any visitors looking for a great spot there  at work we cater a good 90 of our meals with them as its always a big hit among college kids,positive
vimala cooks  everybody eats  fresh  locally sourced food with a commitment to food justice and workers justice what could be better than that well  the food is really really tasty  i went for lunch  which meant no wait  as they just started their lunch service so quick  run over for lunch now before everyone finds out and it becomes as popular as their dinner service  i had the chole batura plate it was delicious  in addition to the yeasty batura bread and the chickpea chole  there was some kind of yummy slaw hiding under some chopped tomatos that was holding all these complex flavors  the dish was pretty good  then i tried the slaw  and it made it perfect  vimala came out a few times to ask how everything was  offer me some chutneys  and a second helping of the yummy batura  the lunch prices  though not cheap  are certainly reasonable given that the food is coming straight from local farms    there are tons of vegetarian options on the menu  vimala and her crew are very friendly  the prices are decent  the philosophy behind the food is one i can get behind  and the food itself is super tasty  this may be my new favorite place to eat in the triangle,positive
jack sprat is   1 a good restaurant as far as food goes i recommend the soups yummm as well as the santa fe wrap  2 a good coffee shop the coffee is good  atmosphere during the day can be studious but not overly quiet  and plugs are available for those with lap tops  3 a good bar there is often live music and generally a good crowd with good vibes here   overall i highly recommend this place,positive
just to repeat what so many people here have said best veggie burger in the triangle its amazing homemade goodness i usually get mine with goat cheese  caramelized onions  lettuce  tomato the fries are delicious  but come in huge portions i recommend splitting them with a friend it wont save you all that much money since they have a combo deal  but it will save substantially on wasted food yum the staff are also really nice  and the dipping sauces are delicious   i really miss living near buns  when i crave a veggie burger and fries buns is what i want,positive
i love this place its just so cute the building itself is unique  and its overall a very nice place for lunch or dinner with friends  as well as a nice place for a date more importantly  the food is awesome and the service is consistently good they have a wide array of both vegetarian and meat dishes everything ive gotten here and ive been a lot of times has be top notch delicious comfort food my personal favorite are the blackeyed pea cakes theyre amazing,positive
prior to last night  the last time id eaten at elaines was november 2007  not a reflection on elaines at all  but there was always something newer i wanted to try  piedmont  rue cler  watts  etc  those are all good restaurants  but in the fogginess of the last few years  somehow i ended up thinking that they were as good as elaines  i was wrong  elaines laid down the fucking law last night  i had the heirloom tomato sampler and the kurobuta pork chop and was in heaven from the first bite  heirloom tomatoes came with a salt sampler that was a little gimmicky maybe only because my taste buds are dead from years of smoke and liquor  but still delicious  pork chop and aioli were so good  the wife ate half ah marriage  only weak spot in the whole thing was dessert  i thought the mint ice cream sandwiches were decent  but nothing special  the rest of the meal was so good i cant bring myself to take an entire star off though  with durham getting the lions share of the food hype recently  its good to know there are places like elaines holding it down for chcarrboro  no chance im waiting another 2 years to go back,positive
finally  franklin street gets a restaurant that doesnt serve burritos or subs this place has great burgers and great fries their many dipping sauces are top notch too try the curry  youll love it my gf and i noticved that they serve brand x ketchup  so youll want to use the dippiong sauces instead this place is cheap  delicious  open late  and filling all of the makings of a great franklin st spot lets hope it lasts,positive
most amazing bar in the area they do everything perfectly  wine  beer  cocktails  cheese  charcuterie   chocolate they also have the best bartenders around listen to their suggestions go you wont regret it,positive
one of the best greek salads ive ever had all the greens  veggies were fresh  the grilled chicken was tender  juicy  and the dressing was not overwhelming and oily  im not a bread fan  but they serve warm homemade pita bread with the salad  definitely a good deal for the price my boyfriend enjoyed his gyro as well  in addition to tasty food  they have outdoor seating  which creates the perfect dining out experience,positive
panzanella is becoming another staple restaurant for my boyfriend and me they have an amazing outdoor patio that has a casual  romantic feel their wine list is good without being overly expensive they also have seasonal cocktails that are made from local fruits which look really good  but i have yet to try one  when i go out to eat  i almost always get salads their salads are delicious and well worth the price they use fresh ingredients and all the tastes mesh well the first time i ordered the arugula salad with beets  goat cheese  and spiced pecans perfect the next time we went was during their special seafood dinner i got the poached seafood salad also good  but the arugula salad still wins  if youre not a salad person  my boyfriend has ordered the italian sausage pizza and loved it each time  on a service note  the second time when i went  the waitress forgotdidnt hear me request dressing on the side i hate being an annoying patron and sending a dish back  but she sensed it and immediately asked what she could do she returned with a new salad and with a choice of dressings on the side how sweet   great outdoor seating  great food  great service  great drinks  and to top it off  they focus on using local ingredients what more could you want ,positive
yum yum worth every bite you can sample any flavor and add any toppings you would like  you pay by the ounce choose this over balis  tastes fresher and is cleaner,positive
jaffa or petra petra or jaffa how do you choose  where do you go since they are right next door to one another   its like choosing between right or left and is all based on preference or any bias you have regarding one or the other   i really dont know the back story of why these two places are split  or whatever dramatic thing that seemed to have happened  i just try to base my opinions on the quality of food and customer service  anywayi first went to petra as it always seems there are more people in there maybe because its smaller and looks busier  or all the neon beer signs they make 5 star pizza  and a good falafel pita   however  i recently went to jaffa and i cant speak in terms of the meat products from either placebut the falafel and the pita here were hands down the best i have had  jaffa has won multiple best of slo for a reason   pros jaffa has excellent and authentic food affordable for quantity  very friendly staff clean restaurant wonderful sauces outstanding baklava for only 100 if its your first time its free  cons styrofoam cupstogo wear bums me out   5 stars  will be returning,positive
just went for brunch today based on a friends recommendation  superb  inventive  delicious selections  i had the go green  a scramble with a homemade basil pesto and perfectly marinated mushrooms  topped with fried green tomatoes and fresh mozzarella  got a side of cheese grits that were about as accurate as it gets  the food is fresh  interesting  and yummy  and the coffees not bad  the atmosphere is hipster as hell but the waitstaff is friendly rather than surly  definitely a cozy place for the lgbtq crowd the disco brunch will feel a little like an evening at the midway but not too crunchygranola    please note the service was a little sloppy this morning but  these guys opened less than 48 hours ago  if you go in the next few weeks  be patient in terms of service since theyre a brand new businesstheyre still getting their feet wet  the food is definitely worth a little wait or scatterbrainedness  and i have no doubt things will be running ship shape in no time,positive
damn  green street  you treat me so right  food  consistently phenomenal  cocktails  solid takes on the classics  atmosphere  lively and cozy  you would never even know this place is here because its literally across the street from where the 70 bus picks up and unobtrusively tucked away    what you get is reasonably priced 5star cocktails  a respectable beer list  and a great menu of new americaneclectic dishes  not as harsh a blow to your wallet as cuchi cuchi  not as jampacked as central kitchen  not one of the sketchy bars you normally frequent in this area    if youre in central  go here,positive
i never visited stams when it was on the north side of chapel hill  but boy do i visit them now    just walking into the store is a treat for the senses  the chocolatepeanut butter gelato is worth a trip alone  their creamy caramel chocolates just melt in your mouth  bob droog and staff are some of the nicest  friendliest people ive met in a retail setting  i met a friend for coffee the other day and amy  a staff member brought it over to us  we visited  drank our coffee and left the next day i rememberedoh my goodness  we didnt pay for the coffee  i drove back over and there was bob  the owner  behind the counter  i told him we had not paid for our coffee the previous day and he just smiled as i handed him the money saying something likethose things can happen  can you imagine someone saying that to you anywhere else in chapel hill  stams is a chapel hill treasure  and if you have not visited the store at 54 east please do  youll be glad you did,positive
love alfredos pizza and think  it is the best in the area  we always get great service either when eating in or using delivery if you want more char on your pizza just ask for well done  they are happy to accommodate  this pizza also reheats beautifully   i highly rocco end alfredos,positive
thin crust  delicious ingredients  friendly people the tomato sauce and pepperoni in particular are out of this world  the only downside is the price  but if not for that id be eating this pizza every single daywhich my body cant sustain also  at other places margherita pizza mozzerella cheese  sauce  and basil is extra  while here its their standard  so you really have to readjust your thinking there  this is far and away my favorite pizza place in the whole world lucky me i live and work minutes away,positive
i went here for dinner yesterday  for the first time in years why should i have i can get great indian food at my parents house in plainsboro  i have to say  lesson learned the interior is beautiful  the food was wonderful  and the service was good it was sunday night and pouring  which might account for why it was almost empty  but just in case im writing this review the owners are very very friendly and communityminded  we got dosas  puris  chicken shahi korma  raita  mango lassi  and the star goan fish curry with flounder it was definitely far too much food for two  and we didnt expect one order of puri to be so large the two curries were delicious  hot  and fresh the raita and lassi were authentic and refreshing the dosas were thin and crisp on the outside  soft on the inside  and came with sambar and a great coconut chutney everything came in beautiful dishes  which just enhanced the whole experience it had the look and feel of a much more expensive place  i wanted to try almost everything on the menu we also ended up with no room for dessert i guess its ok because well absolutely come back next week in the meantime there are leftovers in the fridge that i cant wait to tackle  finally despite the lovely atmosphere  it might not be the best choice as a date place we were far too busy eating to do any talking,positive
my favorite ice cream place unique incredible flavors and textures carrot cake ice cream that has a feeling cant quite put my finger on it of actual cake  while remaining wholly ice cream fragrant pink rose and chocolate rose unbelievable youhavetotryit olive oil  which they sprinkle a bit of sea salt on peanut butter oh  glorious peanut butter and local flavors triumph beer  nj cornetc can i get a jersey tomato  and if that werent enough  the hot chocolate is out of this world  particularly the habanero hot chocolate its not a seasonal thingi will go for ice cream in winter and hot chocolate in summer bonus the cup covers are pretty nifty  ok  my wallet cant really handle it on a daily basis but weekly  yes portionwise  i used to be able to eat a pint of bj 7 years ago  and still have a huge appetite for sweets  but the serving sizes here are strangely satisfying though theyre so small maybe because the tastes are so rich  um  and  dont bother with the cupcakes or at least  i dont,positive
best anywhere,positive
always good no matter what you order love the onion blossom,positive
monday lunch  1230 wasnt too crowded large menu with a good selection sides like sweet potato fries spicy potato salad were both good  great sandwiches at reasonable price very good beer selection and offer a beer flight of current on tap look forward to an evening meal to try the entree menu,positive
fiesta cafe has the best mexican in champaignurbana everything isnt made with the same ground beef  there are choices ordered a beef taco and had 4 choices of beef from ground to a chipotle marinade on a nice night  outdoor seating is fun great mexican beer selection and drink specials occur,positive
cant argue with anything anyone else has said   watch out for google latitude directions  you end up catty corner from where your suppose to be   the chrizo nacho cheese was fantastic,positive
the best restaurant in the area hands down i travel all  and have a job which takes me out with clients often finally clairemont has a place which rivals other places in areas like pasadena  downtown  the oc or the westside  interesting menu  the waygu beef is awesome this place is good for brunch as wellfor those who dont like it the prices yeah its not cheap  if you want  cheap and predictable  try all the bland chain restaurants near the mall,positive
the best of all the restaurants  my fav loved it huge portions  tasty lovely  the waiters were great  the food was tasty  cheap i paid around  21 plus 5 for the waitress we had  who was nice this was the second time we went there i had a greek dish the first time the second time i had a greek omelete breakfast plus french toast i loved the food would definitely go there againyummy,positive
yes value for money and the food was tastyyyits a mixture of american and continental food  i had  shrimp salad and a sandwich  huge portion and cheap nice ambience  waiter was moody  but the food made up for it and the portion was huge  huge  huge paid around 25 including tip  will definitely go there againyummy,positive
bella pita is awesome  i usually order the bruin combo which includes a falafel pita  fries and a drink  all three items come for about 78 bucks which is a good deal nowadays  the pita is great because of the customization ability with the vegetable bar  the fries are okay  nothing special but also nothing horrible  i try to stay away from soda but when a place offers coke cola made by real cane sugar  i just have to have it   first time i went here the owner was taking the orders and he made the place feel very welcoming   overall a 5 star place for the great food  nice people and the sugar cane coke  ill probably get my order delivered next time,positive
this place has been around seemingly forever and little has changed  i hope it always endures that way  hawaiian food thats pretty great  portioned for islander appetites  and priced for college students  what more could you ask for  the picture menu on the wall has not changed much since i was hanging around the ave as a student at uw  the choices are plentiful and the staff has always been friendly  im surprised i didnt review this place before because i still recommend it to friends  dont forget that its cash only  or you might be forced to use the atm in the shop and i dont know what that thing charges  but i bet its closer to something than nothing  always great,positive
the cedars restaurant has always been my goto place for indian in seattle  its been at the top of my indian list for years and i love the place  i do love the food here immensely  the butter chicken is fantastic  the nan is usually quite a portion and we always order a couple  plain and garlic  my fave dish  though  is the coconut curry with chicken  yumo  the chai here is also pretty freakin fantastic and theyll keep filling it for you all night long unless its a packed house  i love the baklava that they bring out with the bill  this place is a good place for a casual  yet still nice date or for groups  on the unfortunate side  when it is packed is a terrible time to go  i mean terrible  its not that the food goes down in quality  but you can be sitting around waiting for more service for a long time  its understandable and it can get ridiculously busy  especially on a friday evening  but it can be aggrevating if you arent interested in waiting for the food  i always think its worth the wait  but still try to avoid rush hour  unfortunately  theyve missed the baklava that used to always be brought out with the bill a couple of times in the more recent history  unfortunate especially because its a great ending  we just had to order it then  lastly  and also quite unfortunate  is the parking situation  ever since that walgreens moved in next to it  the cedars parking has been pushed across the street to safeways lot and there is little available parking there  if youre lucky youll find a spot in there or right on brooklyn  but if youre smart youll walk or bus over,positive
howzit  its awesome  thats how it is  i had never heard of pams until i read about it from nina n i love food from the west indies and pams is somewhere that will make me forgo many of the other locations in seattleits really that good  i had lamb roti potatoes and lamb  spiced  curried  and put into a piece of rotithink tortilla  but more pliable  and quite a bit tastier served on the side was a cabbage  not shredded lettuce  salad to drink  i had some rum punchmmmm mmmmmi think it was spiced with ginger and to top it off  i was asked if i wanted some hot sauce feeling saucy  i accepted  good lord their hot sauce is hot its habenero mixed with something its got the consistency of applesauce  its dully yellow in color and its hotter than the coals found in hell  or at least thats where they found this stuff be cautioustalk about kicking it up a notchit kicked my arse up a couple of floors  the service and atmosphere nicely accompany the decadent cuisine here as trinidadiantoboggan music bumps  youll be catered to by the attentive staff  do i recommend pams do you like all your toes,positive
best pupusas ever well  at least this side of the border guanacos serves absolutely authentic salvadoran cuisine  the pupusas especially the veggie and the pork tacos being my favorites pretty much everything here is amazing even just the rice and beans just have a little something special in them plus  this is the kind of local business that seattleites need to support the owner is officially one of the nicest guys ever and always greets me and my company warmly oh  yes  the prices are great as well it doesnt look fancy from the outside  or the inside for that matter  but the food is fabulous and by far surpasses the pretensions of somewhere like la isla not that i am not a fan just too expensive to frequent i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i swear if i have anything to do with it  they are going to be the next big seattle food craze  as long  of course  as business is still booming here  its all good the guac i am not so fond of  but hey  where else can you get a side of guac for 75 cents no where  thats where love guanacos  support guanacos perhaps someday ill be granted the masa dough recipe gooooooooooooaaaaaallllllll,positive
edit i love hoppy beers now took me long enough big time gets a big time upgrade from 4 to 5  now that i realize each and every one of their brews is gold   so its a saturday night  and you find yourself on the ave at a bar so crowded that it takes 5 minutes to get a drink  and when you finally get to the bartender  you have to shout at them over the blaring top 40 music just so they can hear your order you think  what the fuck am i doing here i just want to enjoy a few beers with some friends that i can actually talk to without shouting at then you suddenly remember that brewpub down the street in the quaint little brick building  and you realize that all hope is not lost   on any given night  there will usually be a few tables open where one can enjoy good beer  good food  and have a good conversation with good music pearl jam  pixies  ccr  etc playing at a decent level in the background   im pretty much in love with their sandwiches particularly the cascade and pink cadillac also to be had are very tasty pizza slices  chili  and most everything else on the menu   as for the alcohol  theres only beer lots and lots of craftbrewed beer  which thankfully drives away the i just wanna dance and drink vodkaredbulls crowd im not a huge fan of ipas  or really hoppy beers in general which several of their brews are however  they do have an excellent porter and a delicious brown ale   looking for bud light mixed drinks a dance floor loud pop music trendy and hip decor thankfully  you wont find any of that here,positive
jumbo lamb and beef gyro for 5 really  this is all that matters ive been here for lunch  dinner  and most frequently at 1 am after leaving big time or finn mccools no matter what time of day  the service is always fast and the gyros are always delicious and filling cash only shouldnt be a problem  as there are both wells fargo and boa atms within a block and a half of this place,positive
im hooked with this place one of the best gyro i have had cash only and they open late i always get the 9 jumbo highly recommended,positive
my favorite dish is the alpha sig plate chicken katsu  spicy chicken  egg  fried rice  throw in a lil extra for the spam masubi,positive
good food  good beer,positive
my coworkers recommended this place to me and then i saw it on man vs food i came here thinking it was just a tourist trap and was pleased to know that it has great food the sweet potatoes fries are great and the burgers will stretch your imagination and satisfy your taste buds   everything i have had here is terrific i have had zuccini fries  potato fries  sweet potato fries  tater tots  and every burger is just delicious try the black velvet if you are in the mood for a deliciously smooth beer,positive
food the pizzas are as good as everyone says they are dough is light  crunchy  chewy the perfect trifecta toppings are fresh and in perfect proportion to the pizza im getting hungry again just writing this review  value a bit pricey for pizza  but its totally worth the price of admission a pizza should easily feed two normal sized humans so 20ish for a meal for two is really quite a bargain  ambiance if you get there right before it opens  youll likely encounter a line no worries  the orders are taken when you walk in and pizzas take about 3 minutes to cook in those beautiful brick ovens sitting in the communal kitchen area is fun and probably the best seat in the house   service very good  recommended for any true pizza lover and everyone else too,positive
after a long day of walking through the parks and browsing the houston museum of natural science  my and the man were ready for some food so glad that yelp brought me here i ordered the fish tacos everyone raved about  and it was worth it they were no doubt the best fish tacos ive ever had amazing fresh flavor  fish perfectly cooked and huge slices of avocado yum the rice and beans also had great flavor and i gobbled everything up the man had madetoorder quesadillas with the avocado bacon ranch  and those were really great as well love it the balanced great flavors had me wanting more i need a reason to go back,positive
the reputation of luckies proceeds itself by far  everyone kept telling me that i would like this club  i would respond with a long  exaggerated eye roll  my standards are extremely high for clubs  my friend was having one of her 30th birthday parties here    luckies did not disappoint  i had a really good time from the moment i stepped into this club until i left  this has quickly risen to the top of must visit places in atlanta  i hate to sound cliche but if youre looking for a classy  sophisticated adult crowdthis is your place  my sister and her friends ordered food and it was so good  what i didnt tastelooked good    the decor reminded me of a few vegas lounges we went to  very upscale  modern and chic  the dance floor was packed and the music was good  our party was upstairs in vip which is a pretty nice layout  there are secluded sitting areas open to the air which is pretty sweet  if you ask me    luckies gave me everything i needed  fine men that actually buy drinks without stalking afterwards  good bartenders  good music and cool people  i will be coming backluckies is on my list of things to do    loved it,positive
we stumbled upon this place after being at the worst club in the entire city of atlantathe verve  and decided to eat here at 1am  since the night was still early  this place had the biggest pieces of chicken on the face of the damn earth  eating here was the highlight of my entire trip  our waiter was to worried about broads to give us good service  i firmly believe gladys night would not approve  beyond thati had a good t ime and felt really comfortable here    you must go here,positive
their phone number is easy to remember 404 tralala and they usually have a student special  i think the one now is 999 for a 3 topping large,positive
my parents were visiting over the holidays and we decided to give this place a try after hearing good things about it from some chinese friends  the decor is okay  not too shabby or overly ornate  but the bathrooms were very clean  we ordered from the chinese menu and tried crab and fish maw soup  twice cooked pork and squirrel fish  along with hot green tea and rice  the soup was the least impressive of the three  it was rather bland  had only a tiny bit of crab meat and consisted mostly of egg white drops and this styrofoam textured thing that had no taste fish maw  but it was nice and warm  which hit the spot after a chilly long walk from the unc campus    next  the twice cooked pork came out and it was every bit as authentic as it should be  it was spicy enough to make you want to gulp down rice  but not so spicy that it would turn your appetite off  i usually dont like spicy foods  but i enjoyed this dish very much    the squirrel fish came out last and it was a large fried tilapia  with the bones removed  but the head and tail intact  it was served on a bed of shredded carrots  glazed with a sweet and sour sauce and garnished with pine nuts  peas and carrots  i liked it because im a sucker for anything fried and covered in sweet and sour  but my parents said it was a bit overcooked  but we still enjoyed it nevertheless    the bill came out to about 40 for the three dishes  the fish being the most expensive at 18  overall  i liked this place and the offerings are quite authentic as far as chinese food goes,positive
i tried this place last week and it was pretty awesome  after circling the small parking lot fruitlessly  i ended up parking on the street  the mcdonalds next door is supposedly pretty towing happy  so i wasnt going to tempt fate by parking in their spots    i ordered their special of the day  which was a panini with italian ham and prosciutto with provolone and some yummy veggies inside  i also got an order of their homemade potato chips  omg  those chips were to die for  greasy  but oh so tasty with little bits of herbs and salt on top  i ate the whole thing  the sandwich was warm  gooey and delicious  the amount of filling was enough  but not exactly stacked  it also came with a little side of carrot salad which i enjoyed as well   overall  i liked this place and will return to try their other sandwiches,positive
ive been eating at 35 at least once a month since i moved to chapel hill five years ago  dont go there if you are expecting exotic or authentic chinese food  because their offerings are very americanized  but if you have a palate like my little brothers  who considers panda express to be the definition of great chinese food  you will love this place  my favorite items on the buffet are pan fried dumplings  these are juicy  tasty and totally awesome  i usually load up my plate with them if they have just been refreshed by the kitchen staff  my second favorite dish is the eggplant dish  it doesnt look like much  but try it if you like eggplants  i love that stuff  it tastes just like my grandmothers  i also like the salt and pepper shrimp  though it takes a bit of work to peel them  theres a good variety  ranging from the typical orangesesamesweet  sour chicken  broccoli beef to fried salmon and steamed flounder  they also have a variety of little steamed chinese dim sum  theres a nice fresh fruit and dessert section  with a candy bar for your soft serve ice cream  i also like their egg drop soup  which they bring out to you with your drink order    overall  i love this place and will continue to go there on a regular basis as long as i live in chapel hill  its not pf chang  so dont go there expecting that sort of service  but it is a great chinese buffet in a college town that will fill belly for a very reasonable price,positive
ridiculously positive and plentiful reviews for a reason fresh  fast  delicious and reasonably priced some of the best falafel  if not the best ive ever had,positive
i come here mainly for the veggie delight and whenever i feel guilty from eating too much junk food over the days the food here is extremely healthy trust me i know since i was briefly obsessed with nutritionfitness for a period of my life the amount of salad you get is obscenely large  a good deal for the price and i swear to god that i just feel better after eating their food you almost always have portions left over so you can eat it for lunch the day after  which is awesome because it means you dont have to cook very important for a college student,positive
one of the many reasons why i moved from nyc to oakland  this place is sublime at 2am  nights are judged as top dog nights or nontop dog nights    a top dog night is a night that lasts a lifetime or at least till the next weekend  favorites hot or a bird w chili  remember to be patient,positive
its like the max and the peach pit for boalties damnit im outing myself,positive
the vegetarian pad see ew wegg here is my favorite thai dish anywhere that it comes from a little momnpop getup makes it even better,positive
best felafel i have had in long long time  possibly ever  and they have a little salad bar from which you pick your favorite garnishments for your sandwich loved that they also had eggplants my absolute favorite vegetable,positive
after spending far too long in the doughnut deprived northeast please dont give me that nonsense about dunkin donuts tasting like anything better than cardboard  finding stans right down the street was like winning the lottery  first  the litmus test chocolatecovered old fashion  honestly  delicious  not as crispy on the outside as i like  but great chocolate and spot on softonthe inside doughnut  second  ohtheplacesyoullgo  ever dreamed of some ridiculous filling in a doughnut  they have it  blueberry oldfashionamazing  peanut butter and jelly doughnutheart attack of flavor  in short  if you want to become a diabetic  try this place  because one is just not enough and nowhere else around will do,positive
this is a great store  went to college nearby  even though i live in north jersey now  im still a bottle club member  amazing selection and great prices  this is the only place you need to for beer  wine or liquor  i think theyre improved customer service and id checking  back in college they had guys at the front door  counter and exit  now they seem to operate like everybody else  iding as necessary but usually just the counter  give this place a try,positive
im in love with teriyaki boy there i said it  ive been going here since college and it my absolute favorite bangforthebuck place  chicken teriyaki with spicy tuna roll and green tea  i dont even have to order it anymore  they remember  even though i only come in once every few months now i moved away but will go here whenever close  dont let the odd location fool you  this is the perfect lunch,positive
uh  if you rated this place lower than five stars you are fucking crazy  its a warehouse a warehouse filled with booze all kinds of boozewine  liquor  beer  crazy shit ive never heard of  etc everything is cheap they have a gigantic selectionsee warehouse many employees to help you with your selection ive been here an embarrassing number of times  im really not sure what else you need in a liquor store,positive
best place on earth i grew up in the area and ive eaten a number 1 with everything on it sometimes a number 3 with everything more times than you could possibly imagine interspersing these number 3s and 1s were many a cheeseburger  cheesesteak and sanchez forget that footlong horseshit you can get something thats at least two feet long here for around 5  its better than whatever sandwich place you go to except maybe georges,positive
when it comes to sandwiches  im very  very simple simple like i only like my sandwiches with the bread and meat this place is perfect for people like me of course you can add more if you like  but if you prefer just two ingredients like me  they sure pack enough to make up for the other missing ones   very simple concept you go in  check off the items you want on a brown paper bag and hand it to the cashier this place is known for their bread never fails to be big  fluffy  and soft all at the same time definitely not able to find any other sandwich joint that has jalapeno cheddar bread like theirs   they pack their sandwiches with lots of meat so much that i really dont know how to start off the first bite half a sandwich is enough to fill me up i like to get the medium rare roasted beef on wheat bread with extra pickles and lettuce then stuff it with jalapeno kettle chips makes a perfect lunch d,positive
we came here on a recommendation from our close friend who is an admitted food snob  i was told that the chicken parm was really good by the snob  and really i have not had an italian chicken dish that has compared  the chicken had a great crunch to it  but the meat was still incredibly tender  the sauce and pasta with it were amazing    i honestly cant fault this place for anything  the service was fantastic  the ambiance was great  if you want me to try to find a weakness it is in an area that is not convenient for me  and since i rarely pass by there i dont get to go back as often as i would like,positive
this is my favorite beer bar in houston so far  its got a relaxed atmosphere and it isnt a scene  which is a plus in my book  if you like to enjoy a good selection of craft beers while chatting  this is the place to go  the outdoor patio allows you to hear your friends without having to ask them to yell  the location is also fantastic  being so close to rice campus and in a nice neighborhood where i havent had trouble finding street parking yet,positive
ive been here several times and have yet to be disappointed  ive had several different sandwiches and salads and they were all fantastic  ive also heard wonderful things about their banh mi from people that i usually accuse of being banh mipho snobs  you order at a counter  but they bring your food to your table and bus your table for you  the big draw here is the quality of their ingredients  they use fresh  quality ingredients from local farms and i suspect that they bake their own bread  which is delicious  they have unique sides that are fresh  tasty  and possibly healthy how can raw vegetables have so much flavor  the service is also fantastic here    the food here is not cheap  but you get quality as well as quantity  i usually have leftovers  athough not quite enough for a full meal    the ambience of this place is delightful as well  lots of light  space  and modern decor  where you can see the food preparation taking place in a big open space  not only is the food good  but its extremely pleasant to eat here   i would caution about eating outside the tables are underneath a huge tree that offers great shade but many birds  and ive had pigeons poop into my salad,positive
handsdown the best pizzeria in town  owned and run by an italian family better than dominos  papa johns and some of the other places  much better hole in the wall kind of place   but  the pizza and calzones are  very very good,positive
i like this grocery store because the lady at cashier is very friendly   she always gives my son a little treat if hes with me  and when im not with him  asks about him  my son even played with her son once in a little back room while i was shopping  although i dont see her sons any more at the store  in any case  there is a lot of personal touch about the store thats totally missing in big supermarkets like tops or wegmans    she always have pure land buddhist chant on in the background  ever since she found out that my boy enjoys reading  she always gives him  different books about buddhism each time we visit them we are not religious but i like the fact that those books emphasizes filial piety hopefully they will help him better navigate tumultuous teenage years ahead shes known my son for about a decade  every time i take him there  she goes like  your boy is growing so big   im giving five stars because the lady is so nice its a totally enjoyable shopping experience  i go there usually to buy a big bag of kokuho rose ie rice  i am also a sucker for sesami balls  i think this is the only place you can get them in ithaca throw them in the oven and let them puff up and grow hot and chewy   such a wonderful treat   if you live in downtown or on west side of town  this is the closest asian grocery store i am too lazy to drive to triphammer mall to the other asian grocery stores,positive
yummie  yummie  yummie in my tummy whenever im feeling really too lazy to cook i start looking around for somewhere to get some food from  i usually dont look much farther than this place they have really huge sandwiches  awesome desserts and if you order hummus it isnt just a dab  no they give you like a whole tub the best part thought they deliver coffee and they even use soy milk delivery speed is pretty good  and they dont have problems finding my apartment like some other places seem to  bonus,positive
several of the other reviewers have stated that the landing is like two different pubs  one at night and the other the day  well its true that however  isnt a bad thing   during the day or very early morning this is the place to catch all the liverpool football games  and being a diehard lfc supporter its heaven most of the others in the pub during games will be lfc supporters  with the random groups of man u or arsenal supporters  but there isnt really any hostility towards the other groups  save for the off occasion here and there the food is pretty good  im pretty picky about food and what i dont like  so i love that i can order things however i want and i dont get crap for it the bartenders are all pretty nice and dont take forever with your orders even when the bar is packed   during the night all of the tables are pushed aside and the bar becomes a nightclub ive only been to thursday nights  which are the drum and bass nights theres loads of regulars who show up every week and are generally friendly the music can be very loud  so bring earplugs if youre sensitive like me   being from the phoenix area its fitting that this is the place i spend a lot of my time the landing is one of those random places i just cant seem to escape  and i dont really want to either,positive
the chocolates are truly outstanding  forget about all the chocolates you had in the pasteven godiva  i never understood why people said chocolates are the next best thing to sexand now i understand   oh mywhat can i say  the chocolates melt in your mouth like buttah  and their hot chocolate yyyuuuummmmmyyyyliterally to die for  although im sadden by the thought of not having this chocolate store in la  i am so relievedotherwise  ill become diabetic in a month,positive
this place is neat i just came in after a haircut across the way from supercuts big spender i know haha anyway cool place to hang out and the people there nice they even that a counter where you can hang out at which is always an awesome thing to have at a cafe i would love to come back here again nice ambiance and good coffee so come and try this place,positive
an absolutely divine place in harvard square  enjoyed the decor  a bite of chocolate cake  and shared some house mint tea with peeps   definitely returning very soon  lovelovelovelovelove it,positive
went here for their grand opening with my fiance and fell in love i love that cambridgeharvard square has a place thats dedicated to honey and everything that goes along with it not to mention their scrumptious honeylicious desserts that they served during their grand openingoh oh yum   they have honey from like all corners of the planetokay maybe thats an exaggeration  but they have honey from lotsa places  check it out,positive
im rating the sandwhiches here i usually order an custom sandwhich  which is some variation of mortadella  capicola  proscuitto  tomatoes  and roasted peppers  all on a baguette all excellent the prosciutto really stands out and silky and salty  with the perfect consistency the bread is great as well the perfect italian sandwhich reminds me of my childhood  i might stop by to pick up some soppressata and cheese for home consumption to see how those are,positive
brunch may be one of those american institutions that seems like it shouldnt be messed with  especially with staples like bacon and sausage forget the meat really veggie galaxy proves you dont need it to get the best brunch in the boston area   i had the eggs benedict  my standby when trying a new breakfast place veggie galaxy takes a unique approach  with herbed tomatoes  pickled onions  and chipotle hollandaise  with a large helping of outofthisworld homefries pun intended my boyfriend had the memorial drive omelet  which includes veggie chorizo so flavorful  you dont notice its made of soy we ended the meal with an amazing slice of vegan sweet potato carrot cake i will come back here my next time in boston,positive
crema cafe gets 5 stars for the sweet potato sandwich alone it sounds like a strange combination of ingredients  cooked sweet potato  avocado  sprouts  green apple  and balsamic dressing but believe me  the flavors come together beautifully kudos to them for coming up with a unique vegetarian sandwich  the only downside is that theres a definite lunch rush and it can be hard to find seating,positive
went to catalyst this past monday night for dinner with a friend the food wasincredible i want to go back immediately ill resist for a little bit  for the sake of my waistline  but seriouslyyum also  the space is pretty neat i dont know what the building was before  maybe a lab  but the high ceilings and industrial feel is pretty cool  it was a little funny  when we arrived and were seated  we had 2 different waiters approach us to ask if we wanted a drink  and tell us about the specials not sure if they were fighting over the table or something  but it was quickly resolved and we only saw one after that sadly  they were out of the crispy quail appetizer  something i had really hoped to try  as well as the candy roaster squash tortellini i guess i will have to go back for those i settled on the carmelized onion soup to start  and it was delicious really great texture and flavor  with the perfect amount of cheesy raclette toast in it my friend had the duck confit salad  and really liked it  it looked pretty delicious  for my main course  i had the tournedos of beef oh my god i hope they always keep that on the menu it was so good so so so good its 2 3oz filets  each on a bed of garlicky buttery swiss chard and parsley sauce  and topped with a taleggio ravioli there were just 2 raviolis  one for each tournedo  but that worked well the flavors were so incredible together i am not a fan of swiss chard  in general  but this was delicious and the parsley sauce  or whatever it was all on top of  was todiefor i really cannot wait to go back and have this again  which is a problem because i also want to try their chick pea fritters and their pastas and their chicken and and and and  my friend had the pork chops  and really liked that as well we shared a side of the drippings potatoes not quite as exciting as wed hoped with a name like that  i dont know  i envisioned buttery and dripping in an oniony fatty sauce or something but they were still tasty   for dessert  we shared the pear almond tart it was very different than what we expected  in terms of appearance  but it was really really tasty and the creme fraiche ice cream was a really neat accompaniment   in conclusion  it was delicious  and i want to go back again and again and again  to try more dishes and have the ones that i already had  again,positive
wow  shocked to see so many poor reviews for thailand cafe   i used to get takeout from tc all the time when i was an undergrad at mit i judge dumplings from other places based on the tc dumplings  because they are just oh so good particularly love the sauces that they include i was recently in central square around dinner time  and picked up some tc and it was just as good as i rememberedand a short wait  ive always been more of an appetizer person  so i can attest to the meat steamed dumplings  spring rolls  and scallion pancakes all being quite excellent ive also tried their eggplant with garlic sauce  and i believe their chicken with green beans  and very much enjoyed both of them lo mein noodles are probably only soso  but the dumplings more than make up for that  definitely coming back here whenever im in central and craving dumplingsin fact  i think im going to order from the arlington location same owners tonight,positive
i realize i have eaten here for dinner more than any other place in boston this past year  it suits me in that it is never crowded  the food comes out fast and it is always really tasty i am not a vegetarian  the first time i went  we thought the staff was really slow now we know that you gesture to the staff when you want them to come to the table  ah ha   i recommend the mango lassi  samosa  chicken korma and chicken masala  friends have tried the fish dishes and the tandoori and all were good,positive
lps was opened in 1958  and is the oldest diner in harvard square the two brothers whip up terrific breakfast meals  sandwiches including their famous chicken breast sandwich 725   and homemade soups 190 for a cup if you want a simple classic try their grilled cheese and crispy fries leos place offers a true taste of cambridge  richie remembered my name from the only other time i went in and that was two years ago,positive
last night i went to rialto with a couple of yelpers granted i have plenty of bizarre dietary restrictions no dairy  no meat  no fun however  i felt completely satisfied after my three course meal and my tab was 13 the cost it normally would be thank you restaurant week  i completely endorse the food and service at rialto my dining experience consisted of two bread baskets with gray sea salt and olive oil you know that really fresh cold pressed kind that taste a bit like grass a salad of dates  artichokes  toasted almonds was fresh and bright my main course of char icelandic salmon was paired nicely with a tingly mint and pea sauce then the glorious dessert toasted coconut semifreddo with chunks of gingered pear bitswas wonderful beyond belief   not sure there is anything in life better than good food companied by good friends,positive
its a rainy boston day and i needed some nourishment and a steaming  cafe au lait crema cafe has a cozy atmosphere with large work tables long enough to hold students  writers  and families just as if you were in a german beer garden you sit together at this place this cafes close encounters has european sensibility of being able to connect people with their community while enjoying delicious food and drink   i opt for the quiche  freshly  made with ingredients like leeks  caramelized onions  and sometimes sweet potatoes when im in the mood for sweet i like the rosemary and goat cheese sandwich with honey  all and all this is probably my favorite new establishment in harvard square,positive
never had a bad meal here  the wait staff is very helpful and knowledgeable when you have any questions  ive also eaten at the bar and enjoyed my time there as well  fun after work bar  too  i cant recommend this place enough  i dont think its particularly hard to find either  on green street  parallel to mass ave  behind the central square tstop  and they have hot salsa dancing on weekends  fun to just watch if you dont participate,positive
i really do love this place  and i love having dinner at the bar  ive had sketchy service in the restaurant when its busy  but who hasnt  i dont hold that against them  love the eggplant  love all the tapas  loved it during restaurant week  and love all the fancy cocktails and the knowledgeable bar staff  one of my favorite places in the square,positive
sometimes b wakes up  turns to me and says  i want pinkberry so  i roll over and oh me i realize that he is actually referring to the tangy  cool frozen yogurt product that we enjoyed in nyc   low and behold  yelp points me to berryline and all is well b rad and i hit up the cute little shoppe one fine evening and stood in the line that went out the door full of other peeps eager for a creamy probiotic confection    if you are not on your toes  the pressure can build when it is your turn to order and you havent quite decided what to get the toppings really need to be scoped out  unless you can read the sign up by the counter with the choices are you fruity or more of a candy ass tough call how about a combo  i wanted kiwi and chocolate no dice player  the young chapling at the counter said they were all out of chocochips the horror all fruity for me then i selected the original yogurt flavor with luscious kiwi and pineapple i like my fruit like i like my teenage boys  fresh and ripe oh and it was   they had other yogurt flavors  blueberry and cranberry that evening i was tempted by these choices  but the original tangy flavor compliments bold fruitiness so well   my b also chose original and selected reeses pieces and oreo i was so proud  the small size was perfecto and two overflowing topping choices hit the spot for i didnt have any dinner that evening tis okay if i dont have my required daily intake of sweetnessme go crazzzzzzzzy the prices are cheaper than the pinkberry and the quality to me was just as good  berryline is bradget approved  teee heeee awww precious,positive
i cant get you out of my head mother i am hungry and i yearn for you   do you ever yearn  often  i sitand yearn i yearn to be in your warm womb with the muffled sounds of others enjoying your offerings  i yearn to taste your salty soft boiled peanuts  pressing the shell against my lips and popping them gently into my mouth i yearn for your french style gnocchi and the creative way you made my vegetarian soul warm with summer squashes and bright tomato kisses  instead of the suprisingly delicious mushrooms you provided me on my first visit  you are too good to me mother   i yearn for your sticky sweet butter lathered on the crunchy corn bread  i think about you too much i scan your menu page for new offerings you keep me on my toes  i have never felt this way before,positive
this place rocked  my sloan friend took me here for saturday lunch  and it totally exceeded all my expectations  i loved how fluffy the crepes were  too often the crepes are too rich and oily  making you feel gross afterward  but the eiffel tower crepe was just perfect  with plenty of flavor  without overloading the crepe with too much cheese and oil  im not sure if ive had a better crepe  i wish stanford had a place like this right next to campus,positive
only been once  but over a weekend of trying three highly rated independent coffee shops in boston  this was the best  very tasty espresso and perfectly crafted drinks  brownies look great  and it is cool that you can buy a half bar  though i havent tried it yet,positive
i work in harvard square and eat lunch at veggie planet often enough that they know my name i recommend eating lunch there because you can sit at the tables at passim whereas dinner can be a bit crowded i am a vegetarian and i love coming here for the array of yummy pizza and salad selections at a decent price my favorite pizzas are lunch for henry  mexican bean  portobello redhead  caesar salad yep  thats a pizza the special salads and pizzas are usually delicious as well,positive
i took my mom here for lunch on her birthday it was a cold snowy day and we were seated right by the fireplace with a very diligent firetender who kept us perfectly warm and cozy the service was perfect and the food was really delicious i started off with the mushroom phyllo appetizer which had a perfectly flaky crust  with a center that was creamy and meaty with mushrooms in a way that only a non meateater could appreciate then i had the scallop special with an amazing red pepper sauce my mom had the butternut squash soup not vegetarian and the linguini concarciofi with grilled chicken homemade pasta and delicious sauce we ended the meal with one of the best key lime pies ive had real limes of course and fresh whipped cream we had to restrain ourselves from licking the plates this would be a great romantic date  especially if you sit near the fire,positive
when you meet good friends for a sunday brunch and their seriously adorable two year old is hungry  a gigantic line out the door at the friendly toast is just not going to cut it enter abigails   a gracious second option that turned out to be a perfect choice  even if they didnt have any crayons and coloring in pictures they let us come in  even though they werent officially open for another ten minutes and we had our pick of the seating arrangements  a nice curved booth with two tables pushed together to accommodate our party of five service was excellent  the occasional check in without feeling like theyre hovering or interrupting  friendly and warm they went out of their way to offer some extra choices for the little miss and she eagerly chomped down on the fresh watermelon and a well done egg the adults were happy with their choices  from the spinach and tomato omelette  to the pulled pork hash  and brunch skillet we were allowed to linger over our coffee  tea  and bloody marys without feeling rushed and the conversation topics frequently returned to the stylings of phil collins and the whereabouts of mike and mechanics as the kitschy but fun 80s throwback soundtrack crooned overhead  somehow it just fit with the brunch timing abigails should be a first choice and shall be next time we brunch kendallstyle,positive
this is hands down my favorite pizza of all the pizzas i have ever had  seriously  and i live in new york well  i was raised in the boston area and now i live in new york but my pizza allegiance has up till this point been entirely to new yorks pizzas okay technically ottos is from maine but thats beside the point   the point isyou have got to try their pizza for 3  i had a large slice of the roasted tomato  ricotta and basil and it was to die for yes there are no seats  yes i had to sit on a bench outside in the freezing cold in the snow to eat the slice  and yes it was entirely worth it and i am getting a little too passionate about ottos right now seriously people stop complaining about how theres nowhere to sit step outside  sit on a nice bench  peoplewatch  breathe some fresh air  and enjoy a delicious slice of pizza  nehu unfortunately i am heading back to new york again tomorrow and will not be back in boston for a bit but damn  i am so happy to have walked into ottos this afternoon i will definately be back here,positive
in search of a good place to fetch both meat and veggie burgers i found charlies on yelp  considering most the reviewers were content with the food but not with the service  when almost every other burger place in the area seems to be frowned on tasteprice wise by the majority of yelpers  we went  the boyfriend had a double guinness cheese burger in his words  extremely  really good  i had the vegetarian reuben on rye and it was nothing short of amazing  so filling i couldnt finish my jalapeno poppers or even attempt the fries  the service was friendly  we were attended by not one but two waitresses second was possibly a bartender  the boyfriend says its his new favorite place  hes pretty picky so id say they surpassed expectations   music was muse and jenny lewis,positive
i am infatuated with your ginger steamer   it doesnt hurt that this was the site of the best first date ive ever had  magic happened in this cafe,positive
aha   a restaurant that does a vanilla with caramel shake right   the shake i had here was paws down the best ive had ever   i never wanted it to end,positive
live yelping from shays right now this place is extremely cute with great outdoor seating great music and a nice homey vibe glad we finally checked it out,positive
crema cafe is really the only decent cafe ive been able to find in or near harvard square  and thank god its here crema cafe has great coffee and really great food the sweet potato sandwich is really good and the scones both sweet and savory are fantastic maybe the best scones ive ever had such a great alternative to the starbucks around the corner,positive
i love this place  the food is amazing  everything is fresh  delicious  healthy  and so cheap  the egg and eggplant pita sandwich rocks my socks off as do the many salads i have had there and all of their lemonades  where else can you get mint lemonade  star anise lemonade  or lavender lemonade that tastes amazing  not too sweet and its only 2 dollars  they also make their own hot sauce  which is the best stuff i have ever had,positive
the darkness of their chocolate must have its own gravitational pull  because for some reason i keep ending up here  try the singlesource hot chocolates if youre a true chocoholic they also pull a very nice espresso the pastries are near to perfect  most importantly  this place is an automatic little slice of home  with enough atmosphere  personality  and sheer happiness to warm you up on even the coldest of winter nights,positive
amazing bagels for a decent price  the location in a strip mall made me wary of this place  how good could it really be if its down the sidewalk from a subway  the answer awesome  the bagels were fresh and doughy  though by the time we got there at 11 options were very limited  the service was friendly and there were lots of seating options  i had a bagel with egg and swiss  delicious  just a word to outoftowners they wont toast your bagel unless you ask  definitely worth a stop at for breakfast  coffee  or even just bagels to go,positive
one of my favorite places in bostoncambridge ever this is the place to go for the best sandwich ever i always get the roast beef and horseradish sandwich  which comes on the most amazing bread ever with amazing crispy thin fried onions their sticky buns are also heavenly  of course ive also tried the raspberry spritzer which was very refreshing with my sandwich overall  joanne change is a genius who  by the way  constructed a massive birthday cake for harvards 375th birthday google it  beware though at lunchtime it gets super packed  so be prepared to wait in line for a while  or get there at about 1145am to beat the rush,positive
i think upstairs deserves credit simply based on its unique decor and ambiance its a great place for a special occasion or brunch i had the grilled sirloin and it was cooked perfectly  was tender and juicy  and was really delicious overall i have also come here for lunch and had their burger  which was also very tasty,positive
the dark hot chocolate is amazing and the macaroonsluxembourgers melt in your mouth with a delicate and delicious mouthfeel  you really only need one or two  but eventually im going to work my way through all of the flavors  the only downside is that if its a cold day and you want to sit indoors and drink your hot chocolate or eat your mousepenguin truffle  it can be a long wait,positive
if you are a fan of candy from around the world or of specialty chocolates  be prepared to spend at least an hour in this store  if you dont have a sweet tooth  there are lots of different salts  mustards  sauces  oils  and other specialty food items as well as a deli full of delicious cheeses and a wine selection to keep you entertained  even better  their website sells gift baskets including a kosher gift basket that you can buy for a foodie friend    or for yourself    ,positive
i shouldve written my review way back when i visited beirut back in september last year  i just found my notes and am actually pretty embarrassed that i didnt write it sooner  this little holeinthewall  is a family run establishment  it is truly a holeinthewall  where service is as honey dripping sweet as their home made baklava  everything is made fresh  everyday  portions are healthy and you feel very welcome and at home  we ordered almost everything on the menu  and still couldnt get enough  the owner spent quite time talking with us about his family history i kept asking  his ties back to ma and a very well recognized jeweler he is related to  the art work and his children  extremely friendly folks  who put their heart and soul into their meals  they serve a garlic excessive yogurt sauce that would make cardboard edible and keep dracula away for a week  and man  we couldnt get enough of it  we dipped fries in it  their lentils are fantastic  as were the falafel  lamb  salad  rice and other items on our table  we literally sampled almost everything on the menu  for a fraction of any of our normal meals  it is a no frills cafeteriastyle place  plastic utensils and paper plates people where the food is awesome  flavorful  inexpensive and service is warm and friendly  so why is it a 5 star in my book  because you cant beat the value and the soulfulness of simple food really well made  exceptionally well made  that has the character and the passion of the people that cook for you and take your business to heart  yes  even i can find 5 star dining in a hole in the wall  and im glad i did  this is great lebanese food  served and prepared by some really down to earth people,positive
i tend to hate crazes  mostly because the main sentiment is craziness  cherry on top has been a pleasant surprise  though  i work across the street and have ended up going there a few times now  mostly for the tullys coffee they serve mate for all of you tea fiends  and theres nothing better than a sugarcaffeine rush at noon  whilst i was there today  they played a friendly fires song too in the hospital for those of you musically inclined folk  nothing like shakin your bootay while making it bigger  i tend to like a little junk in the trunk  especially my own  ok  i wrote this a while ago  and i have to say that my expectations have been blown away  the owner rocks  the staff is quite friendly  and even when the place is busy they still find the time to help  dont ever leave  cherry on top  i shant ever cheat on you with another,positive
why do people insist on reviewing places based on what theyve read  if thats how the world worked id never leave my apartment  this is yelp  not your mothers house  nobody cares    i tried this place a couple of weeks ago  and it was quite delicious  the frozen yogurt sorry  i cant bring myself to say froyo for fear of violently vomitingits one of the only words that actually makes my insides hurt is really soft and delicious  and like the previous snob noted  wont give you lovehandles or diabetes  i dont go to confession after eating frozen yogurt without mochi  so im ok with the plethora of other wonderful items they have    the waffles are pretty damn awesome too  and  if you actually look at the sign which reads fresh fruit salads and hot dogs  its not primarily a frozen yogurt place  and its colombian    if youre in pasadena and want to try some tasty waffles  hot dogs  or frozen yogurt or go for all three  i dont judge  tutti frutti is your place  its not pinkberry  which is always a good thing when youre not in the mood for overdressedtrustfundhannahmontanalookalikes      id give it four stars  but the first review is so ridiculous i bumped it up a star,positive
fast  cheap  tasty  just as described,positive
great food truck  delicious burgers and josh and team are very friendly  the specials are the real treat though  whether its filet mignon sandwiches  thai fish soup  or lobster rolls  dont ask questions  just order the special and enjoy,positive
very good  very large sandwich,positive
great new food truck  get on their email list to follow them since they are not on twitter  have had the banh mi  the chicken pita  and the dry aged burger and all three were very good  i think  the greek style chicken pita on the homemade grilled pita is my favorite  very glad these guys set up shop so close to the office,positive
the following items on the menu are the worlds best microbrewed beer  nachos  bread  olive oil  fish  chips  i stumbled upon it with my dad during my freshman year of college  and i was blown away by the food  and once i was able to drink legally it became my hangout for the remainder of college  perfect place to bring out of town visitors  dark  cozy  intelligent  its true boston,positive
crushes pinkberry  red mangos original yogurt is sweeter and tastes much much better with fruits  with anything  than pinkberrys tart mediocre yogurt,positive
the best thing ive ever had in my entire life  and so cheap  and so simple that i find it hard to describe it to friends and family back east  amazing  and i wonder why there arent carbon copies opening left and right  as is the case with pinkberry,positive
came here for sunday brunch buffet with my usc friend  im new to indian food and the thought of being able to try several different dishes made me so excited i wanted to poop  its a tiny  intimate  no frills place with flatscreen tvs showing indian music videos and we were greeted by this lady in a sara who gave us the warmest  most attentive  grandmotherly greeting of my life  better than my own mothers after i got back from iraq i didnt really go to iraq    she brings you water and a basket of naan you can choose between regular or garlic garlic  then you grab a plate and dig into one of sixteen different dishes chicken and tofu curries  palak paneer  mushroom curry  jasmine rice and yellow rice with peas  items from the salad bar like yogurt w carrots and cucumbers  vanilla custard wfruit  mint or tamarind chutney  and for dessert drum roll gulab jamon  a crazy sweet doughnut soaked in more sugar  all for 9  the cost of brunch  then i pooped,positive
what the fuck  closed  well  i can cross that off my list when i visit home  this was the secondbest brunch place that doubled as an amazing bar at night in boston  after soundbites in somerville  shiiiiiiit  rip  bside,positive
the last review i read is correct  sooooooooooo much creamier and less tart than pinkberry  im a fan and will most likely not be going to pinkberry provided that more red mangos open up  i had a medium plain with strawberries  raspberries and carob chips  delightful    theres even a cool loungetype area to hang out in if you get there early enough to snag it  yum yum and yum,positive
delightful  delightful i cant believe its only 160 calories but i highly recommend this spot  my friend had the pomegranate which was tasty and i had the donnatella versace and something else  cappuccino and cookies  go and get 2 scoops,positive
i ordered the don its a pretty good sandwich  and its averagely priced  i love how they shave the cabbage to thin pieces its easier to eat it that way,positive
the best fro yo in la their fro yo is very natural fructose free,positive
love at first bite my girlfriend introduced me to this place two years ago and i am still in love with their carne asada burrito my friends and i hit this place up at least once a month its cheap  fast  and good it tastes very authentic it doesnt taste americanized i have also had their chile relleno once before it was good but i still love their carne asada burritos more  i dont think i could handle their carne asada fries just looking at them makes my blood pressure shoot up,positive
the cheapest oooorgasmic experience in los angeles diddy riese contributed to my freshman 15  but every single time i ran  i lived in westwood  to diddy i left with a smile my favorite diddy is vanilla ice cream between a peanut butter and sugar cookie it has never disappointed me theres always lines outside  but be patient and you will get your diddygasm its the cheapest dessert in westwood only 150,positive
i thought shops like this doesnt exist anymore because these days desserts like these are overpriced and over sweet   delicious cookies 3 for 1   ice cream sandwich for 150   open late hours  basic  simple delicious cookies and ice cream   my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nuts cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream mmmmmm   this place will knock your sweet tooth off and will definitely win you over then any overpriced ice cream sandwich food trucks  or overpriced mrs  somebody cookies shop ps the only negatives are cash only  and parking,positive
if i had gone to ucla for undergrad  it would have been freshmen 35 at least with diddy riese right around the corner    bad breakup    hot summer night   study break    all perfect occasions for a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two warm cookies   for 150  i am glad i live far away enough that i can only get it once every couple of years,positive
the best pizza ive ever had was in new york cant remember the name and in boston a place in the north end it turns out that the bostonian place was owned and run by the grandmother of the fellow who owns and runs damores pizza a mini chain in la somehow he manages to create an absurdly great pizza with insanely low amounts of fat and calories  compared to slop and crap giants like pizza hut  dominos  etc this guys pizza was rated as the number one pizza in the country by another ratings site that i shant mention here on yelp  why lemme tell ya incredibly thin  incredibly crisp crust that has leagues of flavor in it  along with massively high quality ingredients quite simply  the tastetexture combination is superior to any pizza ive had in la  and i am an immense pizza snob you have to like this particular style  of course if you prefer soggy  spongy  greasy spoons like the aforementioned pizza behemoths  you will be sorely disappointed ah well  your loss  i spoke with the owner  who was at the front serving customers  and discovered a place where the workers are friendly in that east coast kinda way hell  i actually found myself talking to other customers thats right  los angeles  talking to other people the vibe and decor are perfect and inviting   i worry that if he continues to expand  then the quality will go down  but based on my one experience here  damores will be my first choice for pizza when i have the urge i cant speak for his other locations  but the one in westwood is primo youll pay for it  he imports the water from boston  and you cant make a great a great pizza with cheap ingredients im wiling to fork out the extra dough to eat a pizza that had me blabbing and smiling about it all night long to my girlfriend yep  it was that good,positive
i love this place the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is always inviting their grilled vegetable salad is to this day the best ive ever had and ive had a lot of them  i love that they serve breakfast all day and i had one incredible egg white veggie omelette i have no idea what it was about it  but it was one of the most flavorful and delicious omelettes ive ever had i can almost taste it nowoh sweet goodness plus  i love supporting a small business  something about that just makes the saladomelette even better,positive
this is the best chinese food in ann arbor  my favorite thing there is the chicken in pineapple nest  fantastic  the service is also topnotch  friendly and fast  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is really nice too  i highly recommend it,positive
they now have chicken curry pasties if you have an idea for a pasty  let them know  fantastic people brilliant in every way i will drive 100 miles here every couple of weeks just to stock up in their deliciousness,positive
their homemade salsa and chips you get free with your meal is so freaking good i always go through 2 baskets good guac too big portions  fresh ingredients  not greasy and you can see your food being made a big plus for me when eating mexican i guess its nothing special  but they dont seem to do anything wrong which for the price is way 5 stars blows taco roca and baja fresh away in my opinion staff is always friendly good outdoor seating for people watching,positive
best thai in slo good atmosphere if you want it spicy you really have to convince them if you order medium spicy it will taste like what you would get if you ordered mild in a big city thai place  get the pineapple fried rice and the pad ke mow you wont be disappointed the waiters always seem kind of shy and unconfident but they get the job done,positive
keep is simple and get the gyro plate fresh made hummas and pita im not a fan of the schwarma  but maybe thats just me i dont really get the petrajaffa thing it seems like the same food to me petra has a little bit better atmosphere except dont eat downstairs but it takes longer to get your food,positive
its not fine dining or anything  but i give it 5 stars because you will get exactly what you wanted coming in here if you think a chicken pot pie or a pot roast wrapped up in a pastry sounds good when you go in  no way youre getting disappointed it is what it is and theyve done it right  just me  but i like the pastys that come with the brown gravy best the red wine reduction drippings is lighter and the cheese based is greasier  service is very friendly  check them out at farmers market portable smaller pastys at a smaller price,positive
get the buzz burrito order with cheddar not american cheese unless you want ruin it nuff said,positive
love this place service is great and theres always a ton of good options to choose from i am giving them a 5 star review because of the value were else can you go and get a full meal for under 10 bucks thats with dessert,positive
really cool store best coffee selection ive ever seen i highly recommend the kenyan iyego beans to die for cool selection of kitchen gear as well its pricey  but if you catch them at their annual sale  which i believe is during the summer months  you can get  some great deals awesome deli as well everything in this store is first class  i love their wide selection of allclad products as well,positive
i cant believe this place doesnt have better reviews ive been coming here for years and always have a great experience frankly  my friend and i concluded that we dont come here enough some people are saying they dont like the interior decor or the atmosphere  and thats what i love about it its dim  wood panel walls  a very 70s vibe the staff is super friendly and treat you like family my friend and i got the hummus and split the lamb kabob its a little pricy but you get so much food for the price you get a delicious salad with an awesome dressing  an egg and lemon soup  which i couldnt get enough of the taste was tantalizing i wanted to drink the damn stuff then our main dish  the lamb kabob on top of rice with veggies the lamb was delicious it was so succulent  juicy  tender  and not gamey upon my first bite i thought they accidentally gave us filet mignon sooooo good  then you get baklava and a desert wine  which wasnt too sweet and had a hint of a coffee aroma and flavor we also got a bottle of greek red wine  which was cheap and topped the meal off delightfully i love this place and will make an effort to become a regular,positive
love love love their food  1 i was amazed at their iphone credit card machine  2 korean drinks  tried a melon soda that was quite yummy 3 theres always a line attesting to its popularity  but the wait for my food has never been more than 58 minutes 4 they have different specials all the time  which keep me coming back to try new korean food 5 i can see them cook food through the window  so i know everything is clean 6 free samples  i love mama kims  and would come here for lunch  dinner  or something in between  i love their korean dumplings made with kimchee it was one of their special items  everybody needs to try out the food truck revolution,positive
absolutely wonderful service and great coffee  i come here regularly and get a mocha coffee the staff is quick and efficient and very fun they are good at what their doing and it looks like they love what their doing very cool environment  fun staff  and most importantly good coffee,positive
good lord how can bread be so good i keep thinking about it and it makes my mouth water i love all the kebabs i would suggest the istanbul grill mixed grill so you can try a variety have a nice cold efes pilsen to wash it down,positive
not much i can say that hasnt already been said  but oh my  the rack of lamb was delicious it really was amazing to me how much i loved it highly recommended my friend really loves the foie gras there as well,positive
i thought i should chime in about shiva since i love it so ill touch on the service since its been brought up ive been more than a handfull of times and only once was i disappointed in the service that time it seemed they only had one actual waiter with an almost full dining room i will however admit that many times i come and wish i could get them to just leave the water pitcher at my table  but thats mostly because the cups are small and i love to order the spicy hot chicken curry murgh madras i love the dal  both the black and yellow good samosas if youre not too experienced with indian food try the tandoori grill 15 it comes with naan  2 types of chicken  2 types of lamb   shrimp  dal  and rice pudding for dessert perfect for 2 people,positive
dont need to write much about this place since most people have said what i would say bottom lineits a must try their assembly line is very efficient and they use all natural fresh gourmet ingredients it dont get much better than that,positive
best place in town incredibly low prices for such great fresh food friendly owners must visit,positive
everything is so unbelievably delicious at this place not especially pricey for the quality  their fresh mozzarella is great pretty much everything they make actually is its basically an upscale new york deli in princeton and a bit cheaper  tip avoid the small world line down the street and get coffee here,positive
i always thought this place was always closed or a front for something until i had to commute for a summer in the morning and discovered it actually open on the way to the train best pastries you will ever find around here served by the hardest working owner ever nothing will be left by 11am,positive
ambiance  service  and food were great for dinner a couple nights ago ive had ethiopian before  and awash met my expectations we happily left a big tip ,positive
dangelos is an allpurpose italian market  its mostly a place to pick up food  though they do have a few indoor and outdoor tables that make it a great lunch place  they have a 5 princeton student lunch box special that is quite a great deal and their food is superhighquality and super tasty  the staff is generally super nice  too  its a great lunch spot,positive
the cookie jar is a wonderful little place right on sixth st next to firehaus and across from tis bookstore  they have excellent cookies  but the best by far are the buttercream cookie sandwichesi prefer the vanilla buttercream frosting  but they make both choc and vanilla  i also bought many cookie cakes here for birthday parties  greek events  sporting events  etcit was the place to go  very friendly service and everything is homemade on the premises  i went back for memorial day weekend this past may and unfortunately it was closed when i visited campusi cannot wait to go back to have a cookie sandwich  mmmmmmm,positive
one of my favorite establishments in the wonderful city of champaign  i cannot tell you how many times i have visited the custard cup during my 5 years  the u of i  favorites grasshopper and strawberry shortcake snowstorms  and the black and white sundae with marshmallow cream and cold fudge their specialty  i only wish that places like this existed in evanston,positive
another establishment i frequented quite a bit while  the u of i  i loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces  fresh parmesan and a huge piece of garlic bread  it was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice  i took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with zasyou cannot go wrong  it does get super crowded during lunchtime  so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right ini need to go back and visit just to get me some zas,positive
this was my favorite place to get gyros in town despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros zorbas vs niros gyros  i always sided with zorbas  the fixins added to the gyro tomato  onions and whatever else you wanted were always fresh and great quality  something that niros seemed to lack on more than one occasion  zorbas had daily specials like groovy tuesdays one dollar off classic gyro meals which kept me coming back every tuesday i attended classes at the university of illinois   however  on wednesday march 23  2011 zorbas was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business as of now  i dont know when  if ever theyll reopen their shop on green st but heres to hoping,positive
mia zas here on green street is the original the other places of similar name just  zas  in champaign have disbanded from the franchise and are their own entities   mia zas is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of campus town conveniently adjacent to the university of illinois main quad  parking can be a bit difficult  but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location  bring money as parking enforcement is serious business in and around campus  depending on the time of day you may be hardpressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population if there isnt enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables  and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling  and italian inspired artwork on the walls  their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients  and everything is cooked to order itll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom pizza  pasta  panini  and salad options but never fear for those you that are indecisive mia zas offers more traditional favorites as well  prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get  and if you get extra items with that said you can get a pick 2 where you get half an order of pasta  salad  or panini served with another half order of salad  soup  or panini for just shy of 7 dollars without drink,positive
every time ive been to cova for dinner  ive had something that blew my taste buds out of the water they change their menu constantly ive never had the same thing twice but ive never had anything i didnt like out of the four times that ive visited its completely evident when you have a meal here that the chef knows what hes doing as a general rule  the plates are composed  balanced  creative  and wellplated frankly  i was surprised that the dishes seemed so well thought out  because its really easy for a place listed as a wine bar to leave menu items as an afterthought and dont dare skip dessert  in addition to your standard ice cream  etc  theres always one creative twist on a classic for example  white chocolate cherry bread pudding ive picked the creative one every time and it was worth every last calorie    my one minor criticism was the shrimp risotto the problem it was just okay and there wasnt much plating when the other dishes make you close your eyes in happiness  just okay seems like a big contrast   they also have very reasonably priced wine flights that change from time to time  which is great if you like variety highly recommend cova for  lets say  a third date   i also had my bridal shower in their wine room  which was perfect for a small  sophisticated cocktail party of around 1520 people,positive
best gelato in pittsburgh huge selection the place is small and usually the line is out the door be prepared ,positive
this review is for the banquet facility my family had a special event in their party room this past weekend the point man a the restaurant was jim and he could not have been nicer or professional he told us he wouldnt be there the day of the event but he made sure another employee  dave  knew of our special needs the event went off smoothly and we could not have been happier with the food  service and price a great restaurant  to stage an event,positive
i dined at ecco last week for the first time what a beautiful interior  the bar is comfortable with several small areas to have a quiet conversation in i found a good selection of wines and liquors if you chose the staff is friendly and dressed casually hip andy  the gm appeared to visit with several tables which i see as a great touch   the food was outstanding and i enjoy the style of serving family style the meat and cheese platter coupled with smaller plates is plenty we enjoyed the wine and loved the choice of carafe sizes   if you are looking for an upscale casual dining experience you can not go wrong at ecco i will certainly be back,positive
love love love locally owned  and has a fun vibe when you enter in they provide wireless internet and a good place to study or have a quick meeting the coffee and espresso never has that awful burnt taste that other places have love the baked goods section they have such a wide variety of items in their display  but i dont think any of it is good if youre on a diet  close to many businesses so its always busy their downtown location is inconvenient if stopping by  by car their broad street location is much better situated for that and less crowded too,positive
i love their weekend brunch a good selection of breakfast items and lunch items  their portions are large and i always have left overs their breakfast dishes come with either a carrot muffin or coffee cake they are both good  the coffee cake is sweet and sugary  so maybe not the best choice decently priced too  around 10 a dish,positive
i write reviews about the food  im sure other things are relevant in a restaurantbut that aint why i go to restaurants  10 yeras ago there was a rash of restaurants that wanted to package nonhispanic foods inside tortillas  i think wraps was the most famous of them  but ive eaten in a dozen such places throughout the country in the last decade  far and away  mondeo pronto is the best    just one more case where the food in slo county is competitive with anything anywhereso long as you dont need atmosphere  my favoritethe one that makes my mouth water just thinking about it is the ahiwasabi wrap  its been a stable fixture of the menu since i started coming here 10 years agoand its still divine,positive
wonderful food  basically all of it  tapas meets california sensibilities  may be the best restaurant in slo county  not much more to say  really good,positive
best thing on the menu spicy chicken sandwich amazing along with some fresh squeezed lemonade gooood enough said   ,positive
why dont people know about this place its easily the best mexican food you can get near usc affordable definitely for sure this place trumps la barca if youre not looking for margaritas  get a mulita super delicious,positive
have had sprinkles millions of times  but this was the first time where i was actually able to sit down and eat it like youre supposed to with the wooden fork peoplethis fork is magic sprinkles cupcakes usually have overly sugary and dry frosting  but the fork makes all of that disappear so that you have one delicious bite of moist cake infused with frosting also the woodiness of the fork adds a bit of flavor  worked well with the banana cupcake as always  the cake is moist and balances the frosting well i spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure out the magic of the fork and think i have it figured outor maybe its just a mind gamebut if anyone else figures it out  hit me up and well discuss our theories,positive
my bro from fullerton came home for the weekend and we made this epic plan to go to berkeley and eat ourselves stupid after an epic meal at blondes  pizza place  we came here we came here for dessert i leave you with this information  we found ourselves having trouble with breathing because all we wanted was to bury ourselves in this amazing stuff they got you wouldnt dare miss out on this place,positive
so much talk of coming here  so many opportunities to do so and then april 5th comes along looking all sunny outside and i find myself next to cream   never be afraid of something new  especially when it comes to sweets i got a turtle cookie literally baked to perfection  soft and chewy and golden gate caramel swirl ice cream in the middle  all for two dollars   it was amazing i dont know how else to put it it was like a dessert from my dreams  i think what i appreciate the most is the freshness of the ingredients  they are making cookies all day and the ice cream was so good and im not even a huge fan of caramel ice cream   to all those who havent experienced it yet  you are definitely missing out,positive
im sorry but caspers hotdogs prices are getting out of control  poor college student can get a damn hot dog for cheap   this place has a huge selection of hot dogs  links  and sausages for 3 dollars only totally sold there was a young guy running the tiny place by himself who was really nice and helpful with me deciding on what i should get   i got a hot link it came on a really nice bread roll and then a guy sitting next to me suggested that i put the krout and the hot russian mustard on the guy had obviously been there plenty of times because thats exactly what i was looking for   the link was really good and all the stuff with it but i think the bread did the trick for me it was toasted and soft  just what i was looking for thank you top dog  next time im hungry and dont feel like spending a lot of money  youll be seeing me,positive
i went to this bar in the 70s with no money and no friends times have come full circle and it has not changed the floor  bar  all the same the vibeperfect for not feeling guilty for drinking at 330 on a monday afternoon if anything the food is lots better and stupid cheap  maybe ill start at noon next time,positive
when i recently went to visit a friend in chapel hill  we went out and came here for a drink or two i immediately loved the atmosphere  probably because it reminded me of some of the pubs here in boston  its fun  lively  and cozy as well  and our waitress was so great she was professional and fun at the same time ifwhen i come back to the area  i definitely want to hit this place up again,positive
if youre in the mood for creamy  thick  flavorful ice cream  then this definitely is the place for you they do have a variety of choices that could fit most palettes  i had the chocolate hazelnut  which really was fabulous  but the belgian chocolate was also delicious the portions are huge i got the two scoops and couldnt finish it it was also about 550 for two scoops  which is pretty expensive however  i definitely thinks its worth the splurgedespite the lingering stomachache that i may or may not still have from it,positive
i madly appreciate grendels  if only for the fact that they fought a supreme court case to keep their doors open  gotta fightfor your right to party  etc etc  anyways  their food is a complaint i hear alot  but its wicked cheap and usually not the reason i come here  the waitresses are unbelievably patient given how disorganized my groups have been  probably my favorite bar in boston,positive
i basically live here  the waiters dont even give us menus anymore because i always get the blonde on blonde w spinach  i was an avid meat eater before i started coming here  and now im a vegetarian  go figure,positive
this place was definitely a staple in my year of being a premed and studying 247365  the woman who bartenders was always really sweet to me  the food feels pretty healthy relative to the other greasy spoons in the square  les is not perfect  but i think its perfectly imperfect  fresh rolls are great  the chicken soup is kickass  the quality can vary week to week  but for its location  speed  price  and general courtesy of all the waiters  waitresses  it really cant be beat,positive
i love it a little dingy which is all ok because they have the best jukebox ever     rock  roll  good cheap beer  yes,positive
this place is hidden in the charles hotel luckily  it closes at 2 am so this is usually the last stop before the customary shawarma run across the street at the end of a night out hotel or nonhotel patrons can come here for classic old fashioneds and the like and crazy drinks like the good guy most of the time the drinks are fine  though sometimes they will make them with slightly lower level liquor  never had the food here  so cant comment on it  the 5 star rating probably includes the sentimental value as well,positive
its a dosa place in the back of an indian grocery store  they play bollywood music videos on a flat screen tv next to the refrigerator where you get your own drinks  this place screams central square  and it is awesome  the dosas are good  comparable to the old rongoli out on brighton avenue  and a lot cheaper  sure  everything comes on an orange tray and in styrofoam  but i didnt come to a restaurant  again in the back of a grocery store  so that i could experience fourstar china service  i wanted cheap rice  some naan  and a good dosa  and these were all things i got  plus the unusual atmosphere of the place    if youre looking for more sophisticated dining experiences  this probably isnt the place to go  if you want an interesting atmosphere  and cheap  solid food  this is a great location  plus  its a little hidden  so you can get some hipstercred points if you know about it and your friends dont,positive
straight up  the best burgers around boston  no problems there  they are huge  malformed  and juicy  theres a thousand options for toppings and the fries will stick directly to your aorta  its heaven on a bun  capped with heartdestroying cheddar and mushrooms  the thing that makes bartleys awesome in my mind  though  aside from just how good the burgers are  is that eating there is an experience  whether theyve always done business the way they have  or whether it was set up to be sort of tourist trapy  i dont know  but its sweet  the place is always supercrowded  so youll be waiting in line on massachusetts avenue for a good 2030 minutes  and a cranky old man will give you menus and pester you for your order at least 15 times before you get to the door  when you finally do get in  the staff will throw you at whatever open spot theyve got  and since most of the place is set up in long trestle tables  expect to be rubbing elbows with another group of people youve never met  if you are an outrageous extrovert  this is a good time to make friends  if not  this is a good time to start a passiveaggressive war with the elbows of the person next to you  to truly enjoy bartleys  it helps to go in with the right mindset  if you like to enjoy leisurely meals with cocktails  this is not the place for you  if you want exotic cuisine or something other than a burger which they do have  but seriously  whats the point  this is not the place for you  if you want a burger  and then maybe a milkshake after it  and you want your face to melt when you eat it  then bartleys is going to rock your burgerneeding pants off    side note if you are coming in the winter  the line is not necessarily any shorter than the other months of the year  make sure you have a good coat,positive
i live at redline    well at least i do every thursday night  go for the great music ngp style  stay for their tasty signature cocktails  and crazy mix of people all doing their part to make redline the best place to be in harvard sq  you have to visit redline on a thursday night  it is totally worth battling a hangover the next day at work,positive
my favorite lunch spot in harvard sq  they have great lunchtime specials  395 for a perfectly portioned sandwich or burger  try the french dip  i promise it will be the best one you have ever had  the food also arrives at your table very quickly so you have plenty of time for lunch and a few errands on your lunch break  this is also a great place to head to after work  all of their food is 12 off from 500pm to 700pm and on sunday they have a variety of apps for 1  fyi rachel ray recently visited this spot and featured it on her show 40 a day,positive
this is probably one of the best places in boston  the service is excellent and very well prepare to answer any questions  the owner whos also the hostess  busser  food runner is very helpful and goes out of her way to make sure everything fine  but most importantly is the food it is simply amazing  the tasting is so worth it since you get to try a little bit of everything i know that this will be my place to go for anything special ,positive
ive been here twice  the first time was a weekend night sometime in the winter  the winter in new england lasts so long i have no way of remembering what month it was  but it was packed with good looking people drinking heavily  today i went and ate lunch outside  its early august  and it was extremely comfortable compared to the heat wave condition that ive grown accustomed to  the lunch specials are about 5 and i have to recommend the spinach pie  rice pilaf thursday only  my date wrapped it up with a cappuccino  which i thought was very classy  then on the way out i gave a couple bucks to the busking musician out in the park  it was a great day  and whether its winter or summer  grendels good,positive
absolutely amazing    be it 2 am or 2 pm and everytime between antonios has the best pizza you will ever have  and its great for people with different tastes  you truly satisfy whatever craving you might have  try one of the amazing concoctions  or just go for hot cheese up front,positive
i came in here with a friend before reviewing a show at the middle east to grab a quick drink it was really crowded in here and people were waiting for tables i was immediately drawn to the warmth and decor of the place it managed to be both welcoming and quirky  without seeming like it was trying too hard to be hipster chic   lisa  the manager  owner  welcomed my friend and i in like we were out of town friends in for a visit she was so nice and friendly and went out of her way to find us a spot at the bar she did while we were waiting  i asked her in my usual fashion if anything was glutenfree  just for future reference she said the kebabs certainly are and that any of the dips could be served with tortilla chips instead of pita bread score whether or not the chips are fried inhouse and therefore contaminate by any glutenous foods fried in the same oil  i couldnt say  but i would certainly check before ordering she said other things on the menu probably were  but as i wasnt planning on eating there that night  it seemed obnoxious to go over each item  once seated at the bar  i ordered a glass of champagnehey  every day in sally world is celebrationworthyand turns out they didnt have any available  but the really nice and adorable in a cute little dress bartender gave me a single glass of one that they only sell by bottle wohoo thanks for breaking the rules  cute bartender chick she was really nice  i didnt get her name  but she managed to be really friendly without disrupting the conversation between my friend and ithe sign of a really great bartender  ill be back for kebabs bonus points for being connected to a venue i spend half my life inside,positive
grendels has now updated their website and their staff on which items on the menu are safe for glutards like me so  if youre glutenfree  head over to their website for a gf menuthey have them in the bar  too  so youll be all set enjoy your quinoa  everyone,positive
if theres one thing that will kill me before im 40  its breakfast buffets  this review is based solely on that weekend offeringits the first and only time ive been there  i was in the kendall area looking for brunch  stopped by mc2  i have to say  it wasnt what i expected  ive only been to 2 types of hotel breakfast buffets soggy piles of mess in some undecorated alcove near the lobby and exorbitant  colorful feasts  i wasnt really up for slop or a 40 meal  but i checked in anyway    i think  at 18  its actually fairly well priced  its not uber fancy  but everything was just good  theres a guy wholl make you an omelet  pancakes are cooked to order  it comes with juice and coffee  servers are friendly  theres a wide array of nice pastries and things to put in your yogurt or whatever someone would put dried apples in  and the breakfast staples stored in those steamy metal contraptions were somehow not damaged by their presentation eggs fluffy  bacon crispeven the french toast had crisp to it  which was surprising given the context    you know  i think im going to bump my 4 up to 5  if this were a few bucks cheaper and if i had some backup arteries for when mine get all clogged  id probably be there every weekend,positive
i used to drive from portsmouth  nh on a semiregular basis to get a fix  usually vienna finger cookie or ginger snap molasses  but if theres a new flavor that doesnt sound repulsive guinness ice cream doesnt appeal to me so much  but earl gray and cocoa pudding win  best ice cream ever  the layout is a little goofy half of the people walk down past the big table and then turn left  half go by the register  making a chaotic line  the chairs are generally uncomfortable  and its crazy expensive for ice cream  five stars nonetheless  also  went for brunch last week  had buttermilk pancakes with warm apple stuff and maple syrup  great little crisp to the outsides of the pancakes  real maple syrup  yum,positive
fabulous place for a beer event william rolled out the red carpet for my group of 20ish for a thursday evening beer meetup   whats more  our server ryan was topnotch friendly  attentive  accommodating and patient   i loved being able to showcase friendly toast as a beer mecca for people in and outside of cambridge its a great option for dinner  too  especially when you want to pair their amazing french toast and delicious whip creme with the beer of your choice   this place is a total win,positive
dan  the gm  rocks   when i contacted him about hosting a craft beer meetup httpwwwmeetupcomcraftbeercrew for about 30 people  he was happy to oblige more so  he was communicative  helpful in selecting costeffective grub options and friendly when finalizing the deets of our event   i cant thank him enough  when we arrived the day of  the staff was  for the most part  friendly as a collective  we felt the bartender was the least friendly  but thats okay  because our group was taken care of by amanda and liz   quickly  when i arrived  i ordered 3 of their delish beer towers  filled with amber ale i also ordered pizza  asking for the slices to be thinner to accommodate hungry beer lovers they happily obliged   i was surprised to see how slow this place was on a sunday afternoonevening  but thats okay it gave us the perfect opportunity to socialize without feeling like being in the way   thanks  dan and cbc for being so gracious we had a fabulous time and will most definitely be back,positive
this just in   grafton street pub impresses with meat and veggie burgers  for meat eaters you can get a pretty mean burger here  cooked to order medium rare tasted amazing especially paired with their rotating tap  berkshires coffee haus porter side salad had a bit too much dressing on it  for vegetarians you can also get a mean  burger here its the toasted chickpea burger and it was delicious it comes with no cheese  but grafton will gladly add a slice  if you fancy that fries were a tad over salted  what a great place  im still in love,positive
loved wowed by great service  really authentic and wellseasoned food with huge portions  great atmosphere  and the fact that its a byob came here for dinner with a good friend on a sunday evening good time to go  by the way  the restaurant was almost exclusively ours shared the caesar salad  papardelli  and the gnocchi with shrimp id highly recommend salento maybe not as a dineouteveryday kind of place because your wallet would be bust as a student  but a special nightsuper yums italian kind of place amazing homemade pasta  attentive service  did i mention super yums,positive
i really want to move to boston and one of the reasons is that i just ate the mac  cheese at veggie planet seriously amazing though the restaurant is tiny  i love the berkeleyesque  downtoearth atmosphere at veggie planet i came here for dinner with a friend and we both had the mac  cheese unreal i always thought of mac  cheese as an outofthecardboardboxseminasty experience  especially when overcheesed  but this one was mindboggling a medley of cheeses  along with tomatoes  broccoli  and scallions maybe a little bit greasy  but amazing im totally coming back,positive
definitely a find i just moved in around the corner and came here hoping to find thai food that would match up to the thai restaurants in new haven success my boyfriend and i loved the dishes we ordered a huge  spicy helping of som tum papaya salad  chicken with basil  and pad thai with beef and the atmosphere of the restaurant is quite lovely prices are quite reasonable  especially given the large portion sizes we had trouble finishing our dishes   pros byob ill remember this for next time  huge portions  wellflavored dishes  friendly staff  beautifully decorated restaurant  cons ill have to think about this ill get back to you,positive
this has to be one of the best pizza shops in massachusetts if not one of the best ever  they use a wide variety of all the fresh ingredients that you can think of to make some of the most delicious slices known to man   upon entering youre presented with a case of various slices and pies of every sort imaginable  some of my favorites a blackbeanavocadospicy chickenranch  buffalochickenblue cheese  honeymustard chicken  chicken quesadilla  tomatobasil  hawaiian  avocado  i could keep going forever because its all great  and yes  for you conventionalpizzaonly people they do have a good sicilian cheese and pepperoni  i make sure to stop here at least once every time i come through amherst and i recommend you do the same,positive
grendels den is my favorite bar in harvard square  low key  good beer  good service  and 5 dollar nachos  i go here for a quick beer and snack whenever i miss dinner  unconditional recommendation,positive
im in los angeles right now wishing i was in the 02138 eating a border cafe burrito ill pay anyone willing to ship me one  border cafe is so good  i used to eat there by myself at least once a week  the chips are ridiculous  and i mean ridiculous  it gets to the point where ive eaten two basket of chips  havent started my entre  and still cant stop grabbing more and stuffing my mouth  they should be illegal just for their addictiveness  every thing else is good  im pretty borring and usually just order a chicken burrito  but damn  that burrito is delicious  border cafe probably not too authentic  but worth the visit  oh yeah  and the prices are great  my meal including tax and tip is usually just 10 dollars,positive
the place rocks   good beer good jukebox good bartenders good crowd good times   sounds like the people from the politely elevated bar crawl are a bunch of douchebags,positive
best deal in the boston area where else can you get a decent meal and a nice beer for under 10,positive
as you can tell by my previous reviews  im pretty much a prick and dont give a place 5 stars unless it is remarkable in some respect   anyway  i cant say enough about how good my experience at abigails was   to start   the staff are outstanding they made you feel right at home from instant  you walk in the hostess  the server  the bartender and even the owner sarah who seemed to greet every costumer made you feel very welcomedand the place was packed   the music is top notch the staff bring in their own vinyl and the choices are perfect i like hall and oats and ian durry a lot   the food  aps guoda fries with bacon dangerously fucking rad      oysters outstanding and huge   entres the way i judge a restaurant is by how well their steak tastes medium rare the grass feed rib eye really got me going it was massive  delicious and cooked perfectly    the drinks wow the bartender knows what t he is doing  well done  oh and ps  to  nancy p  there is obviously a reason why you were sitting alone,positive
i think charlies is cool i was looking for a laid back place to celebrate my 21st with a few friends and i came across charlies on this website a review mentioned it being dirty and the food being soso  but i had a really great experience i got the double guacamole cheeseburger and it was delicious someone had mentioned that they dont substitute sides but the waitress gave me an option of chips or fries it is a mixed crowd  but everyone seems to agree on the jukebox and we listened to great music all night and enjoyed some good beers and good food we even dared to order dessert and the apple dumpling was really good karaoke started around 1030 and this is when it started getting crowded  but we managed to snag a booth and keep it for the night arrive around 9 if you want a seat at a booth or table the bathroom is kind of sketchy but nothing worth losing a star over overall  charlies was a really good experience and i cant wait to go back,positive
one of the coziest spots in harvard square on a winter evening love the brick walls and the cheap menu the half price menu is a real steal and worth the trek out to cambridge usually just go for appetizers when with friends and we often get the hot spinach and artichoke dip my best friend and i were fans of an appetizer that is no longer featured bread with tomato sauce but regardless of the menu changes i still enjoy myself when i go to grendels whether its a humid summer night and you are sitting outside or cozying up inside on a winter night  gendels is a spot where you will find yourself comfortable and at home  among strangers,positive
whenever i walk into sweet the 22 yearold girl i am turns into a 9 yearold at the sight of cupcakes lined up in the shiny case and see the wizard of oz playing on the flat screen the cupcakesomg you know how you walked into johnny cupcakes for the first time and were totally disappointed that the only thing the store provided for you to eat were some mints let sweet fill your cupcake void without feeling pressured to buy a 35 t shirt to fill the cupcake void left by a misleading name   every single cupcake is delicious i havent tried them all but i assume they all rock and i love that they play delicious girly movies like marie antoinette and breakfast at tiffanys all of this writing about cupcakes has reminded me that the last time i visited i ate one in house and bought a dark chocolate with vanilla icing cupcake to go im going to go eat it now and if you are reading this you should head out and grab yourself one too,positive
have gone to this place everyday for almost the entire year now coffee is perfect the sweetest and friendliest people work there very enjoyable atmosphere  food the very very healthy great unique sandwiches with best vegetables highly recommended,positive
hmmmm where should i start i went there with my sister and two friends on a sunday night the place was crowded  must have reservation inside was lovely  very nice ambiance  food was amazing they dont have too many different food  on the menu but everything that we ordered was great a little pricey however  service was good but our server was not friendly at all but he still did a great job serving us he was attentive and had a great timing with food he made a few suggestions for drinks and we were happy with our orders  highly recommended one glass of wine  one appetizer  one entree  12 desert was almost 50,positive
omfg best burritos ever i go to the south west and travel through socal  nm and az and have yet to have a better burritos i know that the real mexican burritos are nothing like this  but for a mission style beanricecheeseveggie wrap this is the place,positive
the most important meal of the day  yes boys and girls there is a place to get a great breakfast at a reasonable price and zoes is where you find it and they know how to do it right no runny or over cooked eggs fluffy buttery goodness all around  one can easily miss this place as its located below and few other stores and restaurants  with a funky  colorful atmosphere much like a 50s or maybe 70s diner i dunno its funky ok   your basics are covered  as one should expect  but it doesnt stop there for those of you with more sophisticated pallets  they provide spinach avocado eggs benedict  several types of omelets  vegetarian  and mediterranean styles   but whats that you say your a big eater  well dont you fret my bottomless pit friend try the three sons breakfast  i did unlike the skimpy portions you might get at ihop or even josephs ii no offense but one will truly be satisfied eggs  beacon  toast  hash browns  and a full plate stacked of french toast not jus 2 slices  extra plus   not only breakfast but burgers  sandwiches and others are offered  smoothies and other drinks but coffee for me black with alil sugar   quick friendly service  and reasonable prices   watch out   parking can be not so fun its right on the edges of harvard square  one might have a wait  but like ive said in alot of my reviews thats not always a bad sign,positive
came here with a large group for cocktails for my friends birthday she called ahead  let them know there would be a larger group  but wasnt sure how many would order food  how many would be there at once  etc in short  a booking managers nightmare but they were supernice and accommodating it being a monday night probably helped quite a bit as well  the service all night was spectacular  from the hostess desk to the waitstaff truly great i didnt eat  but had two different cocktails that were both tasty and very interesting mixes of flavors i will definitely be back,positive
two words for the chilly days mulled wine   when i think of my brief time in cambridge  grendels is probably going to be one of two pubs that i think of its cozy  the staff are nice  the prices are reasonable  and the 12 price appetizers at happy hour make for an awesome afterclass discussion venue   it is smallif youre in a group larger than three and arriving after 6pm or so  it might be hard to get a seat still  its a spot with zero attitude and good beer and ale on tap  grendels slays,positive
i love byob places like this  this is the uws sister of ivo  lulu  service is extremely friendly and the pre fixe price cannot be beat  we showed a bit before 7pm on a saturday night and had our choice of table  within 20 minutes  the whole place was full  everything we had was great  but i particularly enjoyed the pheasant pate and the duck leg confit,positive
a contrasting ambience inside vs out  but both sides of the coin are worth choosing    my trip here was months back  but my impression of this place is entirely comfortable  but also hip  not sweatpant comfortable  lookin like a sloth  not hipster hip  a balance  a wonderful place to run in with friends that you havent seen in a while  entirely conducive to conversation  but not at the expense of your ears you can do work here if need be  but dont be surprised if someone strikes up a conversation but not a cigarette here,positive
my roommate  joce  and i decided to bike to the algiers coffee house today for brunch  we didnt know what to expect  as soon as i walked in i knew i loved it  the restaurant is a two story building with lovely  authentic decorations and full of warmth  we wound ourselves around the staircase to the roof deck where we sat  besides being flanked by a beautiful blossoming tree  we also had a perfect view of the sidewalk  which was great for people watching  joce and i split a big plate of the best hommus very garlicky and both ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich with sumac  there was no rush for our table so ended up spending an hour and a half eating and reading  atop our harvard square perch  oh  and its vegetarian and vegan friendly ,positive
i dont get in to charlies nearly enough these days  when i worked in the square it was a pretty regular spot to hit up after work id lunch there occasionally too cant really beat the pricethough it was always depressing to go in and not order a drinknow i usually only make it down there for the occassionalt trivia on sundays  when we started playing ttriva there a couple of years ago it was a huge improvement over playing at unos and there was generally plenty of room unfortunately  you generally have to turn up at least half an hour if not more in advance to get a table for trivia these days,positive
having worked in harvard square for several years  grendels has always been one of my favorite spots for lunch or for drinks after work  while it can get a bit crowded during the frugal period known as happy hour ive found it a relatively quiet place to lunch  especially if you dont go out until 130 or 200    people have mentioned that the fondues not spectacular well  in the grand scheme of fondue  its not the best out there  but it is still tasty cheese with bread but during happy hour its 10 between 2 maybe more people and i cant think of many places you can a vat of molten cheesy goodness for anything approaching that price  ive always liked the grendel roast beef sandwich and the chicken breast sandwich with honey mustard as well as the shrimp caesar salad all of which find their way onto the lunch menu  one further note it seems you can now drink alcohol outside there though sadly no happy hour on the coveted patio chairs which is something i think everyone who frequents the place has been waiting for,positive
absolutely one of my favorite places to sit and read  i like sitting outside  when its nice but i love the cozy cramped low ceilinged quarters sitting inside  one thing  ive noticed a propensity for tall waiters in this low clearance environmenti just dont get that,positive
this was one of my favorites in harvard square during school  and i was happy to find that it was still going good and strong upon a visit last weekend  my favorite is the potato pizza  which has both sliced potatoes and little dollops of pureed potatoes yum  also delicious is the lobster and corn pizza,positive
burdicks hot chocolate is rich and delicious  i always get the smallest size because thats all i can handle  but i enjoy every sip  whenever im in town i stop by to grab some of the white chocolate hot chocolate mix super expensive  but what can i say  its worth it for my dad who loves white chocolate,positive
how have i not written a review for this place already  i love this place there are so many great memories here for me  so i am biased  i think i would regularly give this place 4 stars  but it earns 5 for some great memories  in sum  great deals cheap  tasty food is always a plus  wide varietyselection  combos such as sundeck combos available for people like me who want a little of everything  friendly service  delicious food  can be a fast meal not waiter service or you can spend a long time hanging outtalking there some people come and go  and no one will bother you about it  outside patio great when sunnygood weather  indoor seating available too  casual  accepts credit cards  convenient location for cal students,positive
first of all  full disclosure i am friends with the owners  secondly  ive been coming here since before i knew them by name when they were still just a chai place when they still had the shaggy orange couch this place is a seattle stalwart and deservingly so  lets enumerate the ways really wellpulled coffee they have a clover and yes  you can get your coffee from it three jillion flavors of chai real yerba mate consistently friendly undiva like baristas commitment to direct trade an alt to fair trade and direct exchange  and support of farmers in centralsouth america more on that here httpwwwthestrangercomseattlecontentoid142605 great location by the american apparel bus stop late hoursmidnight on some nights consistent open mike and music programming cool modern chairs and a new upstairs  youll find this to be some of the best coffee in seattle,positive
this place is great  ive been coming here since high school on the coffee price index using americano as an indicator they hover around a high median  but it is worth it   three rooms of seating  the upstairs especially good for studying or loafing  the front room good for being seen all windows onto the alleyparking lot great alley space  when its nice  folks hang out here and drink their coffee on the sidewalk and benches outside the cafe   sure hope the alley development plans dont wipe out this environment its one of the quickly disappearing weird winchester mansion esque seattle places with multiple entriesexits and tiny bathrooms and weird upstairs rooms and public access tv stars see shifterland pulling your coffeethis means go there   they have open mic upstairs too  though rumor is you cant smoke up there anymore  also  they always seem to have interesting printed materials  zines  posters etc around more so than other places on the ave  oh another thing  if youre older than 21 you wont feel like you stick out like a sore thumb here unlike some other ave cafes  which is a huge a,positive
love this place best vietnamese sandwiches fresh  good tofu  cheap  and theyll put hoisinsri racha on it if you ask them outside of the id hands down the friendliest restaurant on the ave  too i always smile when i leave this place spend money there,positive
light and bright situated on a corner  light wood decor and furniture i could spend some time here  giant boardroom table the only drawback  seats about 24 i think  guess its great if you come in with your entire sorority but if youre just the one person makes it awkward to sit there  at least for me  not being a fan of sharing my space  or my anything else  with strangers,positive
awesome  i loved it  friendly staff  they take the time to prepare your food lovingly and to get to know you  perfect place for fussy nuts like me  though i am not a vegan  i do try to avoid dairy  so eating at a predominently vegan restaurant allowed me to order without worrying about getting a dairy stomach  i had the peanut tempeh dish  my vegetarian friend was worried i wouldnt like it  yeah  right  it was amazing  menu is seasonal  whole thing changes every 12 weeks or so  so go and enjoy  enjoy it now  ps small restaurant  relaxed  nice but casual,positive
this place can be a bit pricey  but it is definitely worth it they usually have a nice line as well  so i suggest calling in your order i like chicken alfredo particularly ,positive
ive been here twice already the first time was at one of charlies friends and family preview nights my friends and i ordered several dishes and ate them family style the food was tasty and it was nice catching up with charlie   the second time around  i dropped by and ordered some items to go because i was too lazy to cook dinner that evening i was just coming from the gym and i was starving i ordered several of the vegetarian dishes sushi verduras  daily tempura  eggplant tiger bowl  crimson quinoa salad  chilly udon noodles  and braised greens  almond butter i couldnt get home fast enough the food smelled so good when i finally got home  i was not disappointed  even the tempura held up i gobbled up charlies food and felt good about it because i know that charlie makes his food only with the bestest  freshest ingredients i cant wait for when the market agogo part of his cafe opens up which is next month  by the way  update 216 just had to upgrade this place charlie has added three types of hamburgers to the menu and i get the feeling that more yummy options will be added as he goes along,positive
amazing crepes with fresh ingredients  made right before your eyes theres a reason that the line goes halfway down the block,positive
lucky i ran into this place when walking around so many soda varieties get the blue cream  from different companies and places ditto for the candy nice retroish atmosphere also,positive
every time my old roomie and bff comes into town  she insists on treehouse nachos better known by the now ancient moniker of hippie nachos and pitchers of beer this place is cheap  open late  and the quality of the ingredients is superb  freshman year  the only heavily bearded guy in my dorm would come here and speak in bombastic spanish with the guy behind the counter and buy the rest of us pitchers because he looked 45 he was also the dorms pot and ex dealer and one time had to chuck his 250 bong and weed out of his window when the administration was supposedly coming to bust him the next day  he was on his hands and knees scrounging around for his weed in the bushes outside his window   now  that tangent is not to say that the treehouse is lax on carding i still get carded when i go there now but i am saying that if youre stocky  have a big ol beard  and speak in ludicrously melodramatic spanish like the radio announcers  you might just be able to slip by them,positive
ive been buying metabolic kitchen meals at equinox the meals are so delicious you definitely dont feel like youre eating diet food   at 13  the meals arent super cheap  but  they are cheaper than almost any meal at a sit down restaurant in palo alto when i havent planned ahead and made my own healthy meal  its an easy and quick fix,positive
i write this with trepidation because a place this fun can only last a few more months before it starts sucking its housed in the old house of blues  and theyve basically kept it all the same first floor barrestaurant  second floor barndance floor look with crap all over the walls that i couldnt really make out in my bleary eyed state lots of balck and white pics i guess ok enough about that   so its basically a small dance floor  but both weekend nights i went  it wasnt crazy crowded they played exactly the music my girls and i would have played had we still lived in dorm rooms and jumped on our beds and danced around in a vanilla vodka and diet coke induced haze it literally felt like we were back in our dorm room when we used to play i touch myself and then whip off our shirts and shimmy up and down bedposts and im getting ahead of myself though  so three years out of college  this place made me feel like a teenybopper again updated music not the same stuff as we had in college   smirnoff and absolut vanilla vodka  lots of nice harvard men and very little competition in the female department a good time was had by all we went here after having a stupefyingly boring experience at mantra in boston but thats another review,positive
sensational  an adult cupcake with oozyfilling  buttercream frosting was to die for  at last nights victory party  i ate a yummy meyer lemon cupcake  a coffeeflavored one  and a chocolate one    im not usually a cupcake fanatic  but these were delicious from the soft cake to the luscious filling to the airy  sublime frosting  worth the occasional splurge,positive
first time here and i loved the decor very homey  warm  and elegant plus they had beautiful fresh flowers on the tables  lily  rose  tulips maybe because it was just valentines  but it was lovely our waitress was young and sweet overall fabulous service  very attentive staff  from host to the food runners      we just thought everything was well presented and delicious we ordered the mushroom cake  which is as yummy as everyone says we also got the beet and gorgonzola tart not blown away by this one  tossed green salad loved the cherry tomatoes and crispy goat cheese  split pea and minestrone soup  clam chowder  mahi mahi  mussels  lasagna  and gnocchi everything was very tasty and fresh i didnt love the sweetness of the mashed potatoes though but overall we were quite impressed by the food and service for dessert we got the bread pudding which was amazing so glad to have discovered this gem of a restaurant,positive
you know youve found a great europeanstyle cafe when you hear a different euro language spoken at each table if the expats like it  it must be good the soups and sandwiches are fantastic  quick  delicious  and perfectlyportioned la douce france also makes their own pastries  and the nutella sandwiches in particular homemade croissants with a nutella overlay are a wonder   the prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and fast several of the same guys have been working there for years  with turnover so low i suspect that management is pretty good to their employees a couple of the guys even remember when i was briefly in a wheelchair following an injury  and still ask how im doing even though im up and mobile a year later  nice people  good simple food what more could you ask for,positive
when i moved out of the mission and away from pizzeria delfina  i thought i was leaving great pizza behind forever i was wrong howies serves the most beautiful thincrust pizza ive had on the peninsula the margherita is superb  and few dishes make me happier to no longer be a vegetarian than the meatball side although there are plenty of fine veg options on the menu  howies hasnt been open for long  but service is so smooth that it feels like theyve been operating for years its great to see a young business flourish like this  and i hope that howies maintains its success and that margherita pizza  guys  yowzer,positive
best place to get produce near my house  it far outperforms wholefoods  safeway  trader joes  andronicos  i love the fruit here as well as the raw pastas  vegetables  olive oil  now if only they had fish  i definitely have to try the redwood city main store someday,positive
tri tip sandwich  espn projection screens during nba playoffs or any type of playoffs  beerbottomless soda  sheer delight,positive
come hungry i made arrangements for a family dinner for my husbands birthday here last night weve been wanting to try it for the longest time and between the churrascarias that ive been to in shanghai  brazil  and ca  this may very well be one of my tops the side bar actually has interesting items from your typical salad bar aside from the meat with side bar option  you can just go for the side bar where the only meats available with that option is prosciutto  salami  anchovies  and smoked trout we also ordered the tres leches cake which was just right   the service  food  atmosphere  are all solid to me and id recommend it to any meat lover looking to kill it ayce style,positive
theres only three things in life guaranteed to put a smile on any twentysomething womans face shoes  sex and the city  and sprinkles cupcakes some people wait for iphones  i wait for sprinkles yes  i was waiting in line for a half hour to get into this cupcakery on a sunday afternoon alongside other cupcake fiends  yes  i heard many passerbyers question if such a thing was worth lining up for bottom line  theres probably always going to be a line to buy cupcakes from sprinkles why because these cupcakes are sweet morsels sent from heaven they arent overfrosted and sugarroided like confetti sprinkled cupcakes from your local supermarkets bakery department  they dont taste out of the betty crocker box from your churchs bake sale  and they dont taste like they have been sitting out for hours and hours or like theyve been refrigerated but yet they still manage to taste just as fresh and moist even 24 hours after youve brought them home  they are soft to the bite  crumble in your mouth  and slather coat your entire mouth with a balanced sweetness good best cupcake that 325 can buy also bought a 250 yogurt cupcake for my dog and as far as i can tell  he can attest to sprinkles ability to bake damned good cupcakes  ps i dont even know why people make a point to categorize the target audience of sprinkles as juicy sweatsuit and gucci sunglass wearing stay at home trophy moms all i saw were families  mothers with their daughters  couples  nerds  friends  etc,positive
yet again  another 5 star review for this place but well deserved i finally got to experience the amazingness that is gracies last night  and boy was it unforgettable  first of all the ambiance alone gives this place 5 stars   stars everywhere  dim lighting  comfy benches with pillows  attentive staff  etcso great  my boyfriend and i split a bottle of wine which the server helped us pick out fantastic choice by her  and we loved it  the fresh bread was also great  i loved the classic french baguette  and with the homemade butter  i could have filled up on it alone  we then decided to go with the prix fixe menu that begins at 40 some special dishes have a slight upcharge  but well worth it  i started with the gnocchi and he had the poached egg  the gnocchi was the best i have ever had  no lie it melted in my mouth with bursts of flavor incredible  for entree i chose chicken ballotine and he had duck  both dishes were completely out of this world with impeccable presentation  we both completely devoured our plates  not a drop was left  dessert time i had the creme brulee and he had the cheese platter  again perfection and devoured in its entirety   we will absolutely  positively  100 be returning to gracies  without a doubt  next time  we are going to try the 7course wine pairing dinner i know it will be well worth the steep 90 price,positive
so good so so good i had the ri coffee milk last night  absolutely amazing  will def be going back to find her to try more,positive
went here for the first time the other day so good bento boxes are perfect for a healthy and light dinner option loved this place,positive

kens kens kens always the best after a full night of dancing the ooeygooey soft sweet goodness of the eclair is my favorite combine that with the savory samosa or paneer wrap in another hand and you reach straight into what paradise must be like their donuts are probably the softest i have had i can go for an eclair right now the owner is always so pleasant and extra props because we share the same mother tongue,positive
you will not have another snow cone better than sno beach i promise you that the ice is shaved so finely that it really does have the texture of snow the flavors are almost limitless they are a seasonal treat so make sure to get as much as you can during late spring  summer  and early fall personal favorite peach tea,positive
while i occasionally have issues with the cash only policy  i give the metro 5 full stars because    i think their prices are pretty great  and they do have a good selection   lots of seating  and i dont know what everyone has against the chairs   huge windows for dragwatching   they have great hours   i can hold tutoring sessions there  and they dont mind if i sit there for an hour and a half without buying anything although i do try to leave a tip or buy something once i get paid   upstairs seating,positive
i first visited toy joy without having heard any of the hype  and i was very pleasantly surprised i visit once or twice a month  and its easy to spend an hour there  checking out the new arrivals  as far as selection  it can be a little overwhelming  and it can take several trips around the store to actually see everything  but ive never had any problem finding gifts for myself and for others at toy joy ive found cool rattles for baby showers  a pirate coloring book they have a great pirate section for a 5yearold  small and inexpensive prizes for the class i teach  graduation presents for high schoolers  birthday gifts for my collegeaged friends  and neat stationarypens for a cousin just last night i was feeling crafty  and walked out of toy joy with a scarfknitting kit and a quilting set  if you cant find something for yourself or a friend at toy joy  its probably because youre really not looking closely enough  mixed in with the kitschy  the cheap  the insanely shiny  and the incredibly bizarre and i admit there are lots of the previous are truly cool puzzles  games  bagspurses  metal lunchboxes  candy  science toys  sea monkeys  baby toys  stickers  plastic animals of all shapes and sizes  varieties of frisbee  penspencils  stationary  jewelry  small pool toys  and even household items  the free gift wrap is also a definite plus  and it has always looked really nice when theyve wrapped gifts for me the staff are generally very helpful  and occasionally will have one of the toys out to play with and demonstrate overall  i think toy joy is a wonderful austin store,positive
took my dad here for an early fathers day dinner  since i wasnt actually going to be in town for fathers day we got seated immediately and the server came right over and took our drink orders  we all ordered various versions of steaks except for the boy  who got a burger  and all ordered them well done everything came out perfect and delicious  and even my son ate every scrap of his food  i have no complaints here  service was excellent  food was great  and we were in and out in under an hour,positive
i have to admit that every pizza place ive ever been to in my adult life has been held in comparison to arnis i grew up on arnis and i know everyone always says whatever pizza they grew up on is the best  but in this case its 100 true  arnis is thincrust  cut into squares  and is very generous with the toppings greasy as all heck so definitely not good for you in any way  shape or form  every year or so when i travel back to visit the family arnis is either my very first stop or its a place i go to shortly after i get there if i could figure out how to have my dad ship me out a fresh arnis pizza i would probably have to do it every month or so best pizza in the world  hands down,positive
this place has great food  i have never had anything here that i didnt think was awesome  i dont mean that i just liked it  i thought it was amazing   the kabobs  moussaka  babaghanoush  all great the have a vegetarian bell pepper item forget the name that is very good too good service  good selection    the moussaka is my new favorite  its got a lot of flavor get the avocado salad if given a choice,positive

walked in and had just about the best  burger in the areathe abricott burger with gouda cheeseit was delicious  i also got the fries which are really  really  really thinly sliced  kinda like hash brown  but crispierthey were okbut the burger was the business  im going back for waffles,positive
ok  first the good news  your establishment is awesome  not only are you serving hot dogs  sausages  brats and burgers on kings hawaiian bread but you also have the best tater tots ever  i love the fact that you are playing some early 80s music on the radio  reminding me of my older neighbors blasting the kmet back in the early 80s  i love the fact that there is a wide variety of condiments openly available to anybody who want themi love the fact that you can customize any of your itemsi will gladly give you 75 cents for sauteed mushrooms  i have to try your chili next time  i love that i ran into a longlost friend at your place  i love that you have an item called the fonz spicy italian sausage and pastrami with mozzarella melted on top  so good and then another item called the chachi  you guys rule  the bad news  you are within walking distance of my job      i cant eat like this all the time okjust sayin,positive
i had the falafel wrap here and it was like 4 it was extremely good  however the chicken shwerma wrap i did not like so much the flavor just wasnt there  or maybe i just wasnt in the moment i do  from the experience recommend you not order that   parking is horrendous at lunch time also,positive
a great find off broxton ave on a beautful sunny day in westwood i was starving the whole day and wanted to find a meal that would be filling and tasty i had preyelped this place and it had good reviews  so i decided to give it a try   theres a great outdoor seating outside  but since it was a warm day  i decided to dine in i asked the cashier their specialities and his recommendations and he was kind enough to explain the menu to me it sounded like everything was great i ordered the la cheesesteak sandwich and their famous garlic fries i took a seat in the dining area and waited for my food   the dining area was very nice  with beautiful tables and chairs and was cool inside it was casual enough for a simple lunch  too anyway  once i got my sandwich  i noticed the dressing on it was drippy and was begging to be be bitten into haha so  i did and digged into the garlic fries as well   ohman   the sandwich was devine and the garlic fries were pretty good too it came with a chipotleranch dip  which was tasty  too i was in sandwich heaven   this place seems to be hip with the college kids  as many of the patrons who were dining there were collegeaged but  i was there for the food i would recommend this place for anyone who wish to sink their teeth into a tasty sandwich superb,positive
the house beers are great here  and if you dont like them they carry an assortment of other craft beers and domestic beers as well  the food here is great  some of the best pizza in tompkins county  great wings  burgers  salads  subs  calzones something for everyone and reasonably priced  plus karaoke every wednesday night in a relaxed friendly atmosphere no pressure to be perfect  just have fun and the host is fair in his rotation  giving everyone a  chance to sing,positive
great karaoke every monday night ithacas longest running karaoke event 14 years and a host that doesnt play favorites  everyone gets a chance to sing,positive
the plantation has been around for decades under a few owners and is still a favorite in the area great food at reasonable prices and specials almost every night of the week if you are looking for a bargain   karaoke every tuesday night is a blast along with 2 for 1 pints of miller lite and molson  large parking lot and a huge deck to sit outside on,positive
great karaoke bar they have karaoke every tuesday and now saturdays also other live music on thursdays and fridays and djs once in a while,positive
karaoke night here every thursday  on their stage with a great selection of music to chose from and a great host ,positive
my favorite restaurant in austin  texas  where i went to throughout my years while at ut  that stuffed avacado entree is just simply heaven  and every time i go back to austin  i have to go indulge that dish  of course  dont forget to order your mexican margarita  the limit is 2 unless you want to try to go to all trudys around austin and get 2 from each  i have known someone to try itand fail that challenge at the second trudys  the only downside i have to this is the wait  unfortunately  they do not take reservations  and you cant get on the list unless your entire party is there  but  trust me  the wait is well worth it,positive
i love love their mocha frap im a big frap fan  so i wish they had more choices for that you know how coffee nowadays is all filled with sugar and creme and etcand thats all you can taste well the coffee you can actually tastes the coffee you can taste the bitterness of it and though i do not like bitter tasting thingsi enjoyed this onevery autheniccoffee yum done just right the couches were all occupied when i came here  but they looked comfy anyway  good atmosphere  good coffeewhat more could you ask for just hope they had more selection in the frap department,positive
pizza here is the thing love the pepperoni and onion  the cheese and mushroom  or the deluxe always fast and friendly  and usually clean stores the thin crust they use is delicious theres the right amount of greasiness without worrying me about getting a heart attack leftovers are amazing garlic bread is a good side so many delicious carbs ive heard tell the salads are good as well strombolis are a good choice if youre on your own for lunch and dont want to eat a whole pizza  like i do  and theres a little train at this location that delivers your drinks to you  and pictures of the town that are like 20 years ago,positive
i miss sadakos great lunch deals  8 for california roll  teriyaki chicken  tempura shrimp and veggies  grilled veggies  pickles  and a soup and salad  and free tea  how can all of that food merit a rating less than 4stars and did i mention their food is awesome  sadako will always have a special place in my heart as it was the first restaurant that i tried sushi  my friend told me to try the sashimi and that was a mistake it was so fishytasting  i was almost turned off of the stuff forever but my friend also let me try some of her dragon roll tempura shrimp  cucumber  avocado  with eel on top and i was hooked the dragon roll is still one of my favorite rolls but i wish is wasnt so darn expensive 10  all of sadakos rolls are pretty good though and i enjoy their donburi rice bowls too    5 stars for the awesome lunch deals  i need to revisit sadako soon,positive
best soup in michigan  this may be a bit of an exaggeration but le dog has some of the best soups ive ever eaten  ive never order hot dogs here and i dont care to  you come here for the soup  and honestly ive never had a bad soup and i used to eat here once a week when i lived in ann arbor    the only bad thing about the place is their very limited hours  le dog is only open 1130pm230pm  mondayfriday the main street location is open saturday same hours  i could make a dinner out of their soup  but alas there were many times when ive had class or a prior engagement that prevented me from enjoy this culinary sensation   that and theres no where to sit and eat in the winter when its snowing   ive even heard that the owner is gourmet chef thats worked in some pretty fancy restaurants   my favorite soup is the peanut udon  its thick  red  and delicious  i also love the chicken tortilla  full of chicken  cheese  green and red pepppers and topped with crunchy tortilla strips  its great  i am not a fan of chorizo or sausage but ive even chowed down on their soups with sausage     the chef pairs each soup with a piece of bread or pretzel bread from zingermans  another quintessential ann arbor landmark known for its great taste and superior quality  to make your soup the pefect lunch    go to le dog  try their soup and prepare to be stunned by culinary perfection,positive
one of my favorite restaurantsdiners in ann arbor and some of the best korean ive ever eaten  the dol sot bi bim bap  served in a piping hot stone bowl  is awesome and for downtown ann arbor is very moderately priced  i also like that they have two sauces to accompany the bi bim bap  a sweet and a spicy red sauce  both of which are tasty  i like the combo meals as well which include miso soup  two differently prepared meats  rice  and different sides depending on the meal  the teriyaki dishes are good as well  the sushi is mediocre but ultimately the korean food is where this place shines  i lived down the street from this place my senior year of college and used to frequent it quite often  the service was great and the owner also named eric haha was very friendly and even starting occasionally offering me free menu items after regularly eating there for about a year   nice people and good food  what more can you ask for   note teriyaki time is not a sitdown restaurant with waiter service    its fastcasual like chipotle or cosi where you order  pay  and then pick up your food and sit down,positive
this place is great for sushi for those who cant afford to go to a fancy place downtown the sushi is great  every time service has always been good  even when the place is packed ive never had any issues in 4 years and 25 visits will always be first choice for sushi on campus,positive
always a happy customer starting making substitutions in my stir frys to get the perfect one,positive
after my move to michigan  this restaurant became my second family  providing me my home cooked meal often two times a week  i gladly ate there three times in two days a few months ago  haha  recommendations kim chi jiggae with beef  the most flavorful kim chi jiggae ive ever had  its so good  it ruined me to the point that i cant eat this dish at other restaurants  because others taste bland  they also put some ramen in  which is genius  this is for the spicy lovers  im partial to beef  so i always order it   dolsot bi bim bap with beef  a rice dish served sizzling in a hot pot  i ask for double egg  the rice is always perfectly made  crispy on the edges and soft in the middle    kal bi jim  beef soup  comforting    dont recommend kalbi entree  their kalbi is a bit tougher and chewier than other places  id rather go to seoul garden or kangs  soondubu  surprisingly  its just not as savory  note  the restaurant is just one long bar table with stools  so its difficult to go in a big group,positive
amazing  i could live on their bran muffins alone  their bran muffins are completely different from anything ive ever had  theyre not the super sweet light and fluffy kind those are good too  theyre the soft  moist  and slightly heavy kind  restaurants all around the world should serve this instead of their complimentary bread   their eggs benedict is to die for  unlike the popular angelos  their bread base is softer and doesnt cut the roof of my mouth  so thats a good start  their bearnaise sauce is indescribable  i would be tempted to take a taste of my arm if it was served in their bearnaise sauce  maybe  and of course ham which is always my friend  i highly recommend the dish   i also like their corned beef hash which they sometimes serve as their special  its okay  you can play hard to get  ill get you  especially since youre awesome  my experience with their omelettes have been hit or miss  sometimes my omelette is perfect  and sometimes it feel like a watery mess as if it was made with frozen veggies  so i recommend sticking with their consistently delicious eggs benedict,positive
incredible food and even better service from the host to the bartender to the waitress  i was surrounded by friendly  outgoing  accommodating  knowledgable  and interesting people whos main mission was to ensure that i had an enjoyable meal and dining experience they succeeded thanks for a great dinner  oh  and you absolutely must try the botanical best cocktail ive had in a while,positive
absolutely fantastic  one of the best restaurants in the greater boston area for sure   tony maws definitely deserves the james beard award for best new england chef    this restaurant is wonderful for celebrating special events for 2 or grabbing their absolutely fantastic burger at the bar  if you want to sit at a table  i strongly encourage you to make a reservation early  if you want to sit at the bar  then try showing up a few minutes before opening depending on the day    their menu changes daily and every single ingredient comes from local farms every  single  one  they are also big on being environmentally friendly  so they encourage deliveries of produce to the restaurant by bike  etc     although the menu is always changing  you can count on their delicious hamburger to be available and for at least one amazing pork dish they really love pork  let me emphasize this hamburger craigies hamburger is without question the most delicious hamburger i have ever eaten in my entire life  i recommend trying it out sometime at the bar    ive been here for the tasting menu  and it blew me away  i had the ultimateextremetopoftheline tasting menu with my fiancee and we were amazed at the beautiful flavors we experienced  i could not contain my excitement the entire night  every plate was perfectly prepared and lived up to expectations  even the desserts were fabulously tasty and unique  and im not a dessert person    a note about the tasting menu craigie generally does not provide wine pairings for their tasting menus  so you will need to choose the wines yourself or ask your waiter for help  this did not appear to be an issue for my fiancee who generally always has wine with her tasting menus   i havent been to lesplalier or menton yet  but craigie definitely has beaten my experience at no 9 park in case you were contemplating between the restaurants  do your loved one a favor and take them to enjoy a tasting menu at craigie  also do yourself a favor and add yourself to their mailing list so you can reserve a table for special events like the masondixon line dinner the james beard best chef winner for the south east region will be cooking with tony maws,positive
excellent food and excellent service  came here for the first time with my girlfriend and ordered a variety of dishes  here they are     shrimp  chorizo snack good but very strong flavor and spices  not sure if i could eat this as an entire meal  but snack is just the right size     braised oxtail appetizer  must order  this was phenomenal  the serving was almost the size of an entree  make sure to try this dish     cous cous crusted swordfish  excellent  i ordered this entree for myself and it was delicious  i would definitely order it again  the apples really added a nice touch     woodgrilled lamb rack  very good  we ordered mediumrare  but looked more rare than i would have liked  still  the dish was tasty  would order medium next time but thats just me  the waiter was incredibly friendly and suggested some restaurants closer to our apartment  overall a wonderful experience  if you are planning to watch a movie at the nearby kendall cinema  the restaurant has a special theatre menu to get you your food quickly so you can watch your show on time,positive
bondir instantly becomes one of my fave restaurants in boston  i must say the meal was exquisite food was well executed loved the ambience  cozy  intimate great service waiters were extremely knowledgeable and friendly   impressive wine list  09 st urbanshof  oekonomierat nic weis  mosel  germany  riesling as good as it gets smooth  sweet  delicious   its always a good night when the wine is delicious  instead of appetizers  bondir offers half portions of the entrees this allows you try more variaty of their dishes   everything is homemade here  we had   breads 9 grain  the sea  barley flour with hops and summer herbs the sea was awesome  made of seaweed   roasted shallotpistachio tart summer vegetable mignardises  rye berries  herbs  sorrel  mustard oil  toasted pistachio powder  buckwheat rigatoni braised chicken and chanterelle mushroom ragu with lavender  garlic scapes  smoked scamorza this was my fave dish the chicken was amazingly tender  scituate striped bass wax beans  roasted fresh onion  guinea hog prosciutto  burnt tomato pure  bronze fennel seed lavash  red wheat spaghetti cacio e pepe australian perigord truffle  parmigiano  fresh pecorino  long pepper  lychee sorbet  chocolate panna cotta bitter orange mostarda  angelica gel  cocoa nibs and pistachio  i had an amazing night here perfect for 1st date  she will be impressed,positive
loved everything we had worth the hype,positive
so i was really in love with zingermans  and no doubt  zingermans is good stuff but then i thought about it  how realistic is it to pay 15 for a freaking sandwich not very realistic at all the perfect solution is here at maize and blue i think the quality is almost as good as zingermans  and for half the price this place really has a ton of sandwiches  i was reading their sandwich menu board for quite a while i think there are literally over 100 anyway  in the end i got the reuben  and the maize and blue special which consists of turkey  roast beef  some wasabi type mustard  cheese  and the usual veggies wow they were both so good i must also mention that you can get 12 the meat for 125 less i ended up doing this and i cant even imagine what a normal sandwich is  because with 12 the meat  the thing was still overflowing with meat so i guess if you are a big protein kind of person thats perfect for you,positive
oh myfreakingod  so i just moved to a new apt and my roomie had to go out and run some errandsmind you i live in mission hill so i dont have a lot of choices for a quick  cheap and delicious lunch  esp when im super lazy from hauling crap up 4 flights of stairs  so i texted my roomie and asked if she could bring back some lunch anywhere and that i would spot her when she got back  she replied with i took care of it  oh snapppppp crackle and pop how sopranoes i was getting excited i will also just say that when im really hungry i will eat anything even if im supposed to be on a diet lol  when she came backand i unpacked my lil surprise i thought i died and done gone to roast beef heaven  its important to point out that i am not a huge roast beef fan never have been even though we have kelleys roast beef  and mikes roast beef and all the lil joints around i just never liked the way it was cooked the meat was always too red for mebut when i took a bite of this sandwich  all my roast beef fears melted away  it was orgasmic  an explosion of beef in my mouthhahha  the roast beef was cooked and not pink it had lettuce tomatoessome light mayoish sauce and it was on top of fresh baked ciabatta long breadmmmmmmmmmmmm   ive actually never heard of flour or even been there but my roomie swears by iti have found a new lovebeef love  my roomie got a portabello and provolone cheese sandwich she is vegetarian and that looked equally as deliciousshe also bought a slice of portabello and cheese quiche qhich was so warm and cheesy it made me feel all giddy inside  i can only imagine what other goodies they have there and i want to try them all  i am ready to make like beyonce and upgrade u   and step into the actual cafe  who wants to go with me baby are u down down down down down lol  hollah,positive
oh man  the baked goods spread at flour is enough to inspire great  great things and i think it does  everyday everything i have tried has hit the spot muffins  quiche  breakfast sandwiches  poptarts  fruit tarts  i could keep going everything is made from super fresh ingredients  and you can taste it they also are incredibly conscious of dietary restrictions its great for vegetarians  vegans  and glutenfree even the bakery section there menu has enough variety that you can keep going back without getting bored and i do  very oftenthis place is amazing  which is why it is usually packed it is worth every second of what can be a long wait such a gold mine,positive
i walked out of park the other night in stunned silence and suffering the most intense food and beer coma i have ever experienced i had a meal fit for a king or some kind of nobility   walked into park  having heard good things but nothing specific so had zero expectations it was a saturday night and the floor was full  so to the bar we went i honestly think sitting at the bar made the experience all the better to start  the service was incredible every single bartender stopped by to see how we were and to joke around there was a great sense of camaraderie between  not only  the bartenders  but the guests as well   the dcor was incredibly cozy and complimented the elevated farmhouse vibe of the menu  the food and beer was everything ive ever wanted and everything i have ever needed i guess you can call me a beer newb  but my eyes were opened by their awesome selection of beers on tap my friend was in charge of ordering beer and apps she did an amazing job of exploring the beer list but her choice of app was the only meh moment of the meal she ordered the chicken wings  which dont get me wrong  were good however  compared to everything else  they were just okay for my entree  i obviously got the daily meat pie how could you put a meat pie in front of my face and expect me not to choose it that day it was braised chicken something with red wine sauce and mushrooms it was a huge portion and i did some serious damage to it i cant wait to go back and see how they change it up my friend got the bar steak which was really quite amazing overall  the food was pretty close to perfect at least for my palate well done  park,positive
wowie i got a grilled chicken  avacado  jicama sandwich and it was so tasty everything was very fresh the chocolate cupcake was fantastic the cake had dare i say an almost perfect texture  i didnt try any drinks  but somebody in front of me in line got a latte and it certainly looked delicious  the place has a very comfortable atmosphere  with people together at tables studying and talking all the staff members i encountered were super friendly and welcoming the music was perhaps a little bit loud for reading or doing work  its not cheap  but its certainly worth every penny,positive
this is an awesome starbucks the staff is really friendly and they always make an effort to get to know their customers they are also very knowledgeable about the different coffees they serve on the clover which i highly recommend trying sometimes the line is out the door but it always moves fast  the store is very spacious for a boston store  and has a lot of comfortable chairs for sitting with your friends or studying the outdoor patio is great on warm sunny days  definitely one of the best starbucks stores ive been to in the boston area,positive
eatin at hungry mother in cambridge was such a singular culinary experience for me  its like nothing ive ever tasted  and damn expensive too  but delicious  and i thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs  the one scallop that they give you shouldnt be plural on the menu  the pot of caramel  the pork shoulder  the pulled pork sandwich with fried onions  the nacho cheese tasting pimento cheese sandwich  the buttery collared greens  gnocchi  and all the drinks  especially the nonalcoholic ones  dad  if youre reading this    catfish is ok here the orange thousand islandy sauce is tasty  but im not sure if id order it again  i wasnt that into the hash  and the pickled cauliflower was a bit wack  maybe i just wasnt expecting that particular combination of flavors  its probably an acquired taste    great date place too  nothing like dim lighting and a picture of thomas jefferson to get you in the mood  i went here on halloween  and the host was workin a little rascals alfalfa costume  wicked    the pear ice cake is really good  but its just a block of ice cream with pear in it covered with chocolate  and lacks the delicacy of the other desserts  hey  if youre into that  go for it  overall  i was going to write off my kendall square food expedition as a bust until i dined here  thanks mama,positive
love   pastries  scones  bread  sandwiches  everything is so yum  my favorites are the sticky buns duh  cheddar scallion scone  banana bread  and tomato mozzarella pesto pocket  it was hard to narrow it down to fourmake it five  breakfast sandwich is also divine  now i know everyone has probably said all the wonderful things there may be to say  but i want to specifically gush about how sweet the people at flour were for my bakery order i placed to bring back the goodies to texas  apparently  one of my uncles goes to church with joannes parents  my mom  my aunt  and another uncle read about flour in the newspaper you know how the story goes suddenly  i get flooded with calls and emails two days before i come back to texas can you please bring me the famous sticky bun  banana bread  pain aux raisin  scone  what is better can i try them all     i called ahead asking if i could place an order for some of the pastries  and they were really patient with me  gave me suggestions for what was goodnot good for traveling  instructions to heat up certain items  etc  i even had to call back to add more items to each of the boxes when i picked the goodies up the next day  they had split my boxes up accordingly and everything was right i was having trouble keeping straight what i needed  but luckily they were on top of it  after 6 hours of travel  security scanning  bumping against oblivious travelers  and accidentally kicking the boxes when under the airplane seat in front of me  all the pastriesscones remained intact somehow  there was barely any movement  and everything looked almost as good as in the store   i would eat here every day if only i also ran 20 milesday to keep up with the calories yum,positive
hands down  my boyfriend and my favorite bar in boston  besides being an awesome neighborhood bar  the food is also amazing  the pork quesadilla and white bean dip are appetizer favorites  the boy loves everything standouts for him are the meatloaf burger and reuben sandwiches  and i love the roasted vegetable sandwich  they all come with a side of either pasta salad  roasted potatoes  mixed greens  or chips    great place to go chill  work  catch the games  relax  or drink up  in fact  i am sitting here at the bar working right now  homey  cozy  friendly  what more can you ask for,positive
the food and baked goods are so good and i think that the best complement i have for this place is that it was literally the first food i had after having my baby  i had been going through a period of intense flour sticky bun cravings for a few weeks and happened to have a sticky bun sitting on my counter at home waiting for me when i went into labor i had to leave it at home and my sister  who was visiting  ended up eating it  i knew this would happen i mused sitting in my hospital bed  so my dear dear husband surprised me with a selection of flour sandwiches and sticky buns for lunch after i had finished the business of having a baby thus making a memorable event even more memorable,positive
i read the reviews out of curiosity and then remembered it has been waaay too long since my last visit to cuchi cuchi walk in and be instantly charmed by the art deco glam craziness  oh and the excellent food and drinks  the tuna tartaravocado mousse cornets are mind blowing it is a bit expensive but the more people in your group the better to sample all the dishes i came here one night with about 10 people and i think we got one of everything off the menu and it was all great the brie en croute is the stuff dreams are made of,positive
by far the best thai food in cambridge  most negative reviews on ylep are from people who got takeout or delivery  thai food has to be eaten right away  so of course those of your who ate the food at home were less than pleased this place is excellent and comes close to what you get in thailand close only  because well never get the fresh thai seafood and veggies over here  so  they messed up a delivery to your company or perhaps  it was you  and they didnt beg for your patronage the fact is  they dont need you as a customer because this place freakin rocks  if you actually go to the restaurant  the staff are efficient and courteous  they dont fawn over you  but why does that matter i go out to restaurants to eat good food  not to get my ego stroked,positive
yelp reviews are interesting  because they prove that you cant please everyone all the time  and i am puzzled by some of the negative reviews  we felt that bondir was spectacular  i can endorse the vast majority of the reviews that are glowing i hesitate to write this review because it is so small and pleasant  and i am worried that i wont be able to come here as often as i plan in the future  the service was warm and pleasant  and we felt like we had been invited into a home the food was uniformly wonderful  with fresh vegetables that were perfectly prepared the scallops were outstanding  and pasta dish was also lovely there arent a lot of dessert selections but they were all tasty  when i got up to leave  i glanced around as i put my coat on almost everyone at the other tables glanced back and smiled  and i think it is because they were enjoying their dinner i am a bald middleage guy  so it wasnt because of my looks  if you are looking for the steak house or huge servings with mashed potato experience  bondir is not the place you wont get 2300 calories in one sitting at bondir thank heaven but if you want fresh  interesting and delightful food  its the place for you before we even got home  wed made plans by email to go again our best friends  and i am planning on eating there every chance i get,positive
totally great place wonderful food  polite service  fantastic desserts as a veggie diner  it is perfect i have eaten there 4 times in the past two weeks  and it was terrific every time two types of veggie burgerboth good regular fries are delicious they get a bit confused on service sometimes  but give them a break  they are new they are trying hard and very friendly this is my favorite place for lunch in cambridge  and a good place for dinner  too my only suggestion is that they need sweet potato fries,positive
i love this place it is not pretentious but the food is always solid the lobster risotto is wonderful and the service is great ive eaten here 5 times and havent been disappointed yet,positive
solid and consistent chinese foodi have been eating here routinely for many years an outstanding bargain i am chinese and grew up on home cooked chinese food  and this is authentic and reliable for a great price,positive
its always a good sign from the brunch gods when the first thing to arrive at your table after the water is a basket of sticky buns  coffee cake  lemon poppy muffins  and savory baconcheese scones  and when said sticky buns taste like butter draped in caramel  and you can literally taste the sour cream oozing out of the coffee cakeits pretty much guaranteed that you are in for a treat  the hits just kept on coming when my eggs benedict with pancetta and a side of red roasted potatoes arrived  the english muffin was nicely toastey and buttery  the bacon was crisp and salty  the eggs were perfectly poached  and the hollandaise was not too thick  the potatoes needed a little bit of salt  but were otherwise tender and made a nice vehicle to soak up the runny egg yolks and extra sauce  for dessert my friend and i split the french toast  which was 3 fluffy  buttery triangles of clearly deepfried brioche  bathed in a caramel sauce with sliced bananas  candied pecans  and a dollop of mascarpone cheese  i dont really think i need to say any more than that  amazing  they had a short list of inventive breakfast cocktails that go beyond the traditional mimosa or bellini  mine was called hits of sunshine and consisted of champagne with raspberry puree and elderflower liquer  which was tart  flowery  and refreshing  my friends passionfruit  honey liquer  and champagne concoction was the winner though  with its sweet taste and velvety texture  the atmosphere was quirky  lively  and sunny at least in the monday club room  where we sat  the carpets are leopardprint  the walls are magenta  or green if youre by the bar  you feel a bit like youre at the mad hatters tea party  but in a good way  its nice to eat at a restaurant that is serious about good food  but a little more lighthearted about everything else,positive
the food is good  the drinks are excellent and expensive  but the reason i went to noir at least once a week all summer long was to relax on the outdoor patio with a martini and a cigarette late at night and do some quality people watching and gossiping with my good friend and noir is an excellent venue for such things,positive
i have had nothing but excellent service and food every time i have eaten here the food is amazing sometimes it is so good that i have to go outside for some fresh air during my meal so i can regroup and go back in to finish it the real upstairs is where i prefer to sit  but downstairs is good too ive also been to upstairs on the square for wine tasting and to the bar for drinks  all of which have been great experiences,positive
we had the best time here the other night the place is adorable there are so many rooms  you really feel as though you are in someones house there is also a bar area  a private room  and a patio that is perfect for a warm night the service was excellent the food was delicious the prices were great and  parking karma was on our side in harvard square this is the perfect date spot or the perfect place to get together with friends or the perfect place to take your parents if they come to visit  the bread and the variety of olives they start you off with are delicious its a really hearty wheat bread and a raisin bread i didnt try   we also started off with a perfect bottle of wine   we all got appetizers one had the special softshell crab  another had mushroom phyllo  and i had the special californian mission figs wrapped in prosciuotto we all shared and mine was the clear winner  we all ordered half portions of pasta dishes i love that they offer halves so we could have apps  save room for dessert  one had the special of the day  pasta with a bolognese sauce of veal and lamb another had the shrimp linguine and i had the linguini con carciofi and i added grilled shrimp it was probably one of the best pasta dishes i have ever had and i live in the north end the sauce was perfect and light and the flavors of the artichoke hearts  tomatoes  garlic  shrimp  arugula  red pepper worked perfectly together    for dessert we split a key lime pie amazing and a vanilla cake topped with fruit and cream i forget the name both were delicious and we finished every bite    it was our first time at the red house but we will definitely go back my boyfriend and his mother remembered paul the owner from his gianninos days so  his mom was able to pop into the kitchen on our way out to say hi to him  which made her very happy,positive
if you like authentic chinese food like me  you will love this place   i am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here i guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and americanized food i never tried the americanized dishes but the chinese ones are decent i always just order their specials  which are listed on the first page of their menu  my favorite dishes are  chinese style mapo tofu   beijing duck you need to order it ahead   fish with the spicy sauce the spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers it has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug    and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots,positive
dear ashleys   thanks for the beer  obviously its incredible  moreso  thank you for not shoving a big ol fuckin tv at the end of the table if i wanted to drink beer and watch tv  i wouldnt have left the house  and appreciate the fact that you want me and my friends to actually hang out with each other  sorry for blowing up your bathroom last tuesday  not my intention  see you soon  love   jerry,positive
i struck up conversation with the guy behind the meat counter for about ten minutes  nicest guy in the world  and took the time to tell me any  everything about every meat under the counter   turns out it was the owner i cant tell you how impressed and proud i am to have this in my community,positive
the same owner of baraonda  then real italian food   its my favourite the wine is awesome  you can find everything you want tagliere di formaggi and tagliere di salumi or affettati  i dont remember are delicious  the best i have ever found in atl i think this restaurant is even better than a lot of italian restaurant in italy   the place is really nice  but small its more expensive than baraonda  but not so much  this restaurant is advised by an italian person ,positive
its an italian market food comes from italy  its like shopping in my country unfortunately they dont have a lot of products  but they have delicious meats raw ham  speck  ham  salami    i usually go there for lunch on saturday  trying their great panini and i shop there a lot  if you like italian food and wine  you should try toscano,positive
i am so glad i got to try this place out it was so packed but so worth it i ordered a slaw dog  a chili cheese dog omgawhh delish we also got onion rings and chili cheese fries my mom got a double cheeseburger  a side salad  everything was really good,positive
bomb cookies for a cheap price cant get any better then that  except  parking sucks  theres usually always a long line,positive
situated on a quite street of midtown neighborhood  ecco is quite different from its neighboring eateries it advertises a european menu and stands up to it fairly well  ecco has a small patio area for outside seating and fairly big inside seating area we went there for late dinner on saturday evening so avoided any waiting time but the place was still fairly busy at 10pm   they have an decent selection on import beers and fairly wide selection on wines food is delicious however the portions were european if you are looking for copious amounts of food  this is probably not the right place fried goat cheese was ridiculous good and lives to its hype we also ordered couple of orders of cheese and they were served at room temperature  uncut the proper way surprising number of places including wine bars get this basic serving etiquette wrong also  i strongly recommend their woodfire grill pizza its thin  crispy and goes very well with their toppings of cured meats   ecco is fairly priced and their menu is well thought its definitely worth a visit,positive
ignore the slightly tacky decor this place is yummy and fast  we got a 30  some noodles  rice  egg role app  and split a thai tea    we were full and everything was really tasty service was good too  even while they were really busy   2332 plus tip awesome,positive
in haiku  its cheap and yummy i mix in peanut butter cups always satisfies,positive
visiting uw wthe bf since he graduated from there  this place is pretty close to campus  thanks for the buttons  alex,positive
i really love this place i knew of it for many years before i actually tried it  and have been back several times since the serversstaff are warm  friendly  and attentive but dont hover the food is delicious  great naan and love their tikka masala and standard vegetable side they also make a delicious aioli theyve accepted coupons graciously when weve had them,positive
i just love them  its a great place to meet someone over coffee or just do homework the spicy and creamy chai here are my favorite a frequent hangout spot for my husband and me latenight they close at midnight  bummer but just glad that they are open after 9 pm,positive
karas cupcakes are really good  they are unique in that the frosting is not crazily sweet like in other cupcake places such as sprinkles  highly recommend not to go there  their cakes are good and moist  frostings are soft and smooth  plus their cupcakes are so cute  ive had a number of flavors there  meyer lemon  chocolate velvet  rasberry chocolate and the passionfruit  all are very yummy  im a chocolate lover so chocolate velvet is my favorite,positive
i had been invited to this place on more occasions than i can remember  my response to each invite upon hearing this was not only a vegetarian restaurant but a vegan one was an adamant no thanks   finally a pretty enough girl invited me along thank you gamze and i could not say no    my eyes my friends were opened that dayscream it from the rooftops vegan food can be goodnot only good but freakin incredible  i love this place the food was so amazing i instantly forgot i wasnt eating meatdidnt even cross my mind that hey there is not meat in this dish just straight up amazing food    as katie o saysfood so good even carnivores will love it  ill drink to that,positive
is it ok if i like it just because i think its fin delicious    i promise im not trying to be trendyi just think it tastes grrreat,positive
oh gyros of aladdin falafel corner  how i love thee seriously  this is as good as gyros can get at a very good price their gyros is at the right temperature  the meat is juicy and flavorful it just all works its one of those places that you walk by and lures you inside with its yummygyros aromas i find this place irresistible  and you will too,positive
this is seriously my new favorite place to eat in the udistrict  their food is deeeelish  the lamb roti is to die for along with paratha  which is kind of like a combination of a flour tortilla and naan  their sorrel drink  a flowerytasting drink  is especially good with the food and goes along with the spices of the food  my mouth is watering from just even thinking about it  the service is a bit slow but friendly  try it  d,positive
you wont miss the meat i promise  this place is so good  every time i go here i leave about five pounds heavier  i just love drenching my whole plate with their delicious peanut sauce  the only downside  this must be the place to bring your kids because little rascals are running around wild everywhere  i mean rice everywhere,positive
id like to take this place behind the bleachers and get it pregnant  only in my dreams  but seriously  i adore this place  thai tom is home to the best peanut sauce ever made and ive consumed a lot of peanut sauce  i highly recommend any dish featuring the delicious liquid gold  the trick here is to go for lunch or slightly before the dinner crowd because it can get crazy  another good bet is to order to go but be prepared to wait 3045 minutes during peak times  there are some adorable shops across the street to kill some time  and dont forget  cash only  dang it  now im hungry again,positive
delicious food  really nice people  okay coffee  but a major reason to go is the giant portions of frozen yogurt the yogurt is on the tart side which makes it particularly refreshing in summer  and if you have it for here it comes in a tulip shaped sundae glass which feels oldfashioned and somewhat luxurious decor is sort of unpretentious indiecraftacularesque,positive
thanh vi has the nicest people running it that you could ever hope to meet their banh mi is excellent as are their salad rolls im so into the banh mi i find it hard to go without it even for a single visit  but they have many other dishes,positive
handsdown the best dosas ive eaten in seattle its homestyle cooking at its best not too oily or buttery  crisp and with really good  spicy chutney the sambar was a adequate  i guess  but overall awesome food as many of the other reviews mentioned  the place is essentially a minimart  but instead of all the liquor fridges at the back  they have a few plastic tables neighborhood is a bit skeevy as well  and with all the muggings going on in that area recently  id be careful at night,positive
the raven grill grows on you  reliable  healthy assuming you dont order the delicious fried seafood items menu at a moderate price  raven has become a go to place for an informal dinner out in the neighborhood  service has been prompt and attentive during recent visits  they do not take reservations  but they do maintain a call ahead list which helps to keep the wait time down,positive
four stars or five stars it was a close call pretty much i had an amazing first experience at benjys and it may very well be a new favorite of mine i think it is actually so i finally visited benjys after hearing so much about their happy hour  from reviews and it being a yelp drinks destination visiting their happy hour was the best decision ever it was very cool the restaurant has a nice set up with the loungy bar upstairs and the patio i came for happy hour and was sure i would order some food off their appetizer menu  i ended up trying the asian chicken salad and the blood orange margarita the margarita was good  my memory is a little clouded of the specifics of that actually but i absolutely loved my salad my favorite food happens to be chinese chicken salad and ive been looking all over houston for a good salad the only place ive found thus far is cpk i love cpks salads anyways  back to benjys the asian chicken salad was amazing the flavor of the chicken was a little smokey but perfect the salad had the right amount of crunchiness and the dressing was perfect the salad was big  so big that i struggled eating the last few bites i was so full  pretty much it was amazing but what was even better  my server  who im sure was a manager when taking my order he could tell that i wanted to try the calamari but he told me it was big so i decided not to order it because he said the salad was big too welp  when he brought out my food  he brought me a little bowl of calamari too so i could try it so the service gets five stars from me  benjys i shall be back soon,positive
i love this place   the chicken is great  they have plantains and black beans florida staples which should be everywhere and nothing is greasy and gross like most other places   i dont mind paying a little more for this place seeing as everything seems so fresh and delicious  plus  dont miss their salsasauce bar,positive
this is my new favorite place i absolutely love the nachos here after finding out they have 2 draughts all day everyday and that theyre open until 2am with a full bar  i will be hanging out here for drinks on the weekend in the near future great food  location and prices,positive
i came here during the fourth of july weekend in 2009 i walked in friday night with my brother about 1030pm and ended up leaving probably about 430am because we were talking to the bartender learning the history of the chili parlor and austin this was easily the best time ive ever had at a bar as a tourist and have never felt more welcome   we ended up back here everyday of our stay 4 days and received the same great service and welcome feeling from the entire staff the manager even gave us suggestions for live music suiting our tastes  good venues  directions and other bartenders to talk to   another thing that brings lots of character and conversation to this place is the fact it was used in a movie and the events that led up to and included the filming of the tarantino movie death proof they even sport the green booze from the movie   in addition to the awesome history and staff  the food is amazing i think i tried just about everything on the menu over those 4 days and loved everything i was served the white chili stands out most in my mind as well as the enchiladas   i highly suggest checking out this little hole in the wall  you wont regret it,positive
im hooked on this place  we were actually going next door to chicken kitchen when we stumbled upon nam the other day when it was kinda chilly outside i saw pho and thought something soup like would be perfect   for starters  we tried the crabtons which even the antiseafood companion thought was very good i had the unphogettable which i absolutely loved  and want to rename the phoking awesome antiseafood companion had the chicken avenger and was also quite happy with the order   the staff was very eager to offer assistance while ordering and seemed thoroughly happy to be there   i guess the best way to put this into words of how much i liked this place the day after eating dinner here  i was bringing coworkers in to try it out for lunch they too agreed we found a new place to have lunch on a consistent basis which we all enjoyed,positive
i love retro  old hollywood glamour  small plates and theme parties  so this year i decided to have a roaring 20s themed birthday dinner at cuchi cuchi we may have dressed the part a little and some boas might have shown up  but we fit right in we were transported back in time as soon as we walked in super cute decor with dim lighting and fabulous music they didnt take reservations at the time we wanted to go  so a group of eight of us planned to meet at the bar for some drinks   even though the place was packed the bartender was attentive and helped select our cocktails they have so many options with cute names and fresh muddled ingredients it was hard to pick just one of course  i settled on the alicat after some indecision  since thats one of my nicknames we also tried the blackberry cosmo and a few others i cant remember the names of i was starving so we also ordered a few small plates  the fried artichoke hearts and prosciutto wrapped melon they were delish the wait was about an hour since we had a larger group and it was a saturday night  but we had fun chatting at the bar and the time flew by   once we were seated i tried the somelikeithot for my next cocktail  a spicy martini with olives that was awesome my friend ordered some of her fave small plates to get us started garlic shrimp and brie en croute  and then we continued to sample as much as we could including the deep fried tomato  seafood stuffed avocado  cuban cigar short ribs wrapped in dough  grilled skirt steak  potato gratin  marinated mushrooms  deep fried zucchini  lamb  puff pastry bites  salad and probably something i am forgetting my faves were definitely the artichokes  brie  the cuban cigar and the skirt steak   our waitress was so sweet  and handled our crazy loud table effortlessly plus she recommended the skirt steak which makes her even more fab and the waitresses get to dress in 20s attire  which is so fun it made me want to work there lucky for you though since i might not be the best waitress i will stick to just stepping back in time for an evening of cocktails or dinner  which ill be doing again real soon,positive
first of all  you have to take it as it is cheap college food so given that  if you want some foie grois  this place isnt for you but if you want some food thats worth every cent  this is the place like everyone else  i must recommend the special carne asada or the nachos try to hit it up when its not crowded  so come for an early lunch opens at 11 i think or a late dinner closes at 1 its small  so take your food back to your dorm  apt  frat house  whatever and their salsa and chips hit the spot too  so yummo  as a starving student  your belly will be the only thing youre busting  not your wallet ,positive
i am surprised at the ratings of this place although ive been only once and did not care much for the service its somewhat difficult to order in spanish  since i am asian  but for the californian who misses innout  this place is for you stick with a cheeseburger and fries  but the fish sandwich looks moderately awesome as well but yeah  this burger is as close as ive gotten to innout  and ive been looking  ketchup is the devils condiment thats why its red dont kill your burger with it,positive
did anyone else read how opal mehta got kissed  got wild and got a life  you know  the book written by a harvard freshman a couple years ago but was quickly taken off the market because it turned out to contain whole paragraphs plagiarized from another authors books anyway  at the end of that book  the heroine finally achieves her dream of getting accepted by harvard  and finds herself sitting at bartleys with a group of fellow john harvards as she bites into her george bush burger  cheesy grease and bbq sauce drip down her chin  and she is filled with happiness beyond anything she had ever experienced reading that  i knew that i  too  wanted to eat at bartleys  in the spirit of the 2004 elections  i ordered the john kerry burger he voted this the best burger before he voted against it   a swiss cheese burger with mushrooms  tomato  lettuce  and fries it was amazing total love at first bite the meat was tender and juicy  and the whole thing was cheesy  savory  and deliciously greasy a few bites in  my chin was dripping with meat juice and ketchup and chunks of halfchewed mushrooms  my attractiveness might have been at an all time low  but id never been happier it was a truly transcendental burger experience thank you  opal mehta  ina k put it best when she said this place is an institution granted  she was talking about a completely different restaurant in a different state  but still  the words fit a boston landmark since 1960 im sad to see it go  update apparently the close is temporary there was a kitchen fire  and the place is only closed until they repair the damage phew,positive
royal east is the place to go  if youre looking for a nice yet inexpensive lunch or if youre taking a group out to dinner  this place on the corner of windsor and main street in cambridge is where you want to be  the food is always fresh and has a nice mix of southernchinese authenticity and americanized taste so its perfect for those wanting a little more than chinese takeout    if youre on the adventurous side  you can always order the specials on the menu  or try the squab youll have to order it a day in advance so they can get the bird  if youre craving even more authentic chinese food  or if southern chinese is just not your thing  you can always go down the street to mary chung in central square  ever since i discovered this place my freshman year of college  ive always come to royal east for comfort food  what i get when im trying to settle down before finals or after a long day  shrimp stuffed eggplant with black bean sauce  its even better for lunch because for 7 bucks  you get the entree  rice  and a bowl of soup  the waiters are friendly  speak both mandarin and cantonese if youre into that  and will always keep your teapot and water glass freshened  come here with groups too royal east is awesome when you order family style  and they have the rotating tray for the food at the bigger group tables  in short  come here for a nice mix of cantonese authenticity and oldschool chinese flavor  and order the shrimp stuffed eggplant d  oh yeah  they deliver for free too if you order more than 25  below that  its 3 to deliver,positive
the burgers are good  the shakes are heavenly i enjoyed a dick cheney just a heartbeat away which is a delicious homecooked style burger with bacon and a side of baked beans everything about it was delicious the side was a bit small  but still good ya  the burgers are a bit pricey  but they are the best in boston without a doubt  the milkshake was hands down the best ive had in boston i had a chocolate and it was everything i ever dreamed of it was fairly cheap too  especially considering the likes of jp licks which is good  but empties your wallet  the seating arrangements are a bit odd  but it fits in with the whole feel of the place also its cash only so hit up the atm first theres always a line on the weekend  and they dont do reservations  so just stand in line outside,positive
i can completely understand some of the negative reviews here personally  i think this is the best pizza ive ever had  beware  during the rush hour  this place gets insanely busy  you have to place your order at the barwith a waitress before sitting and there isnt a wide variety of options pizza  subs  meatballs  sausage and salads  otherwise  the pizza is amazing  the beer is cheapish  wait staff is friendly and parking is easiest in princeton  great for big groups  children  happy hour  sports  but not so much for a quiet or intimate dinner  overall  i absolutely love this place and regular about once a week  did i mention the pizza,positive
best pizza  period delicious thin crust best pepperoni my personal favorite is the pepperoni and garlic comboi always end up eating pretty much half a pie nothing compares i want some now   only problem is they have a very small wait staff  so when tables need to be cleared  drinks need to be refilled  or checks need to be given  thats when one experiences a lag sadly this can be problematic as the pizza is rather salty  so drinks need to be refilled quickly other than that and the long lines  but if you know to be prepared  its not that bad  its 5 stars all the way,positive
love lucys they also opened a restaurant in rocky hill 113  i think  great sandwiches  fresh pasta and sauces large selection of dishes to choose from for take out and reheat for dinner  there will be a long line for the lunch crowd  the line moves rather quickly and its worth the wait,positive
huge supporter of local farms and local businesses  fresh fresh produce  when in season veggies and fruits are picked that very day you may even be able to pick your own  organic section  free range eggs  local farm and supporter of other local  nj businesses  the staff is always extremely helpful and friendly    pick your own with events every weekend in october  they sell turkeys for thanksgiving and their own pies christmas trees for christmas time  open all year  including thanksgiving morning  a great trip for the entire family,positive
this place always entices me with its siren song of exotic ice cream and sorbet flavors whenever i am near today was unseasonably warm  and after a 40mile bike ride down to princeton  i hit bent spoon in a mediterranean kindof mood  where i sampled the heady turkish coffee ice cream  and the tangy greek yogurt ice cream with candied walnuts  which was fabulous  i pedaled away  holding the cup in one hand  and the handlebar in the other  shoving the ice cream into my face i momentarily lost my balance  and the tiny cup slipped from my fingers horrified  i juggled it in slow motion  but it fell to the ground  landing upside down in the street i abruptly dismounted  held up my arms to stop traffic  picked it up  scraped a few black particles off the ice cream with my fingernail  and resumed eating it no way was i going to waste that,positive
abc is one of a kind unless the kind is corner brewery   they have great beers here and i love going to the bar and getting a few samples  working down the list at 4oz per serving is a great way to sample the beer while snacking on some food  good vegetarian choices and the pear  walnut salad is great,positive
i love mani  sometimes the dishes may be hit or miss  but they are at least attempting to think outside the box  and sometimes they go way outside of it    the pickled cherry tomatoes are definitely worth trying for the experience of the sweet vinegary flavor explosion you get when you bite into them  love the ice less water in the table  nothing irks me more than drinking water filled with ice cubes    decent wine selection    will be back,positive
ok  so it might not be the best pho  ramen  tempura udon but eat here once and youll wonder why anyone would go to the noodles  company around the corner  we seem to end up there once a week and were always happy  i happen to think that their japanese dishes are their strongest suit  which isnt surprising considering its called tomukun   try the tomukun ramen  if nothing else  i also like the tempura udon even though the broth lacks a little finesse  the tempura items are nicely executed  duck ramen is nice and hearty  their phos are good though  to be honest  we love saigon garden and we feel a little guilty everytime we have pho at tomukun  our favorite appetizers are the dumplings  none of us are willing to share  so we each order our own not a big deal at their prices  service has always been good  lunch or dinner  quiet or busy  all around  its a fun  reasonable restaurant and always yummy  were huge fans,positive
mani is the best new restaurant in the area  food is fresh and flavorful  staff is kind and decor is eclectic and visually stimulating    the beet appetizer was perfectly prepared  and i had to hold myself back from ordering another  this dish is a musthave for any beet lover  pistachio pizza was a pleasant surprise  and the word pizza does this gem no justice  the cheese was thinly dispersed over flat  crispy dough and there was more focus on toppings pistachios  onions and a touch of rosemary  yum    dessert was vanilla gelato with espresso poured over top  and it was my absolute favorite part of the meal  i would highly recommend this for anyone who isnt crazy about the classic sweet treat  as the gelato and espresso compliment each other perfectly and keeps the flavor of sugar down to a minimum  when you decide to dine at mani  be sure to call ahead and get your name on the list to avoid a long wait,positive
the best quality and variety of meat in the area  period plus  they will happily track down hard to find items for you  like deboned quail or huge quantities of veal bones for stock and  the guys behind the meat counter couldnt be more friendly and helpful yes  youll pay through the nose  but i have no problem doing so for high quality and a great experience theres no better place to wander around and be inspired to put together a delicious meal,positive
id been avoiding grange after reading some fairly tepid reviews here  and now im kicking myself for missing out on this gem of a restaurant both food and service were outstanding last night we started with the charcuterie plate  including generous portions of lardo  the heavenly cured pork backfat  terrific chicken liver and duck pts  and a turkey sausage that was the only just ok moment of the evening pickled vegetables and a beet compote were an excellent foil for all the fatty goodness then  the beet salad with goat cheese was simple and delicious  followed up by two stellar entres i opted to follow pork fat with more pork fat  choosing the pork belly with braised turnips fabulous my husband had what i consider the litmus test for any cook or restaurant roast chicken granges was just what it should be moist  flavorful  with crunchycrisp skin  and delicious baconyfried brussels sprouts to go with we ended with the cheese plate  which included surprisingly complex michigan cheddar and manchego plus a tangy fresh goat cheese  as we were finishing up  the table next to us began receiving their selections from the snacks menu even though we were stuffed  we were jealously eyeing their scotch duck eggs and chorizo  date and blue cheese bites and planning a return visit,positive
wow we just had a fantastic dinner at logan we had had lunch there shortly after it opened several years ago and i had been underwhelmed by the limited lunch menu and the food shame on me for judging a new restaurant by its lunch menu  ive missed many amazing dinners here as a result everything on the menu sounded fantastic  and there are many choices the dinner started out nicely with a tasty potatoleekfennel pollen soup as an amusebouche i had the green papaya salad  which is like a party in your mouth we both had the veal breast as an entree it was unctuous and succulent and absolutely delicious  as were the cranberry beans that accompanied it the biscuits were light and tender and i could have eaten the entire plate of them myself i skipped dessert  but my husband said the poached pear spring roll was fantastic im looking forward to getting loose in the app and pasta sections of the menu on a return visitthe crispy sweetbreads  tapenade gnocchi and wild boar bolognese unfortunately  they had run out of it the night we were there are calling my name   the restaurant is cozy and comfortable and service by larry was outstanding also  we had known kevin  one of the ownersthe guy who runs the front of the housesommelier  from his days at five lakes grill in milford  and even though we hadnt seen him for years  he remembered exactly what we used to drink there  impressive in addition to being a great host  he really knows his food and wine logan has an excellent wine list and will steer you in the right direction on both if you ask,positive
im now in love with manis food and vibe enough to say woohoo  but i do have to qualify my excitement by noting that at normal dinner hours people are packed in 23 deep at the bar waiting for tables  and waiting a long time and  theres no way for groups of fewer than 6 to avoid the wait since mani only accepts reservations for 6 this is really annoying and deterred us for a long time  until we stopped by for an early dinner before the crowds arrived  but  enough negativity the food makes up for the obnoxious waits and reservation policy i love the small plates way of eating  and every dish we had was a knockout the pork belly was maybe the best ive had so soft and unctuous they serve it with a spoon  but with a crispy  salty crust divine also stellar was the charred octopus  tasting simply of octopus but with a punch of lemon  and the onspecial pasta with braised pork the prosciutto and arugula pizza was delicious with a nicely crispy crust i was impressed by the many interesting yet simple pizza topping combinations and will surely be back to try others they also have a reasonablypriced but small wine list with some hardtofind choices  manis decor and atmosphere are modern but warm  and though many of the staff look like they could be toocoolforschool hipsters  everyone was gracious and efficient,positive
amazing food i like that the menu is small this means everything is fresh  the cheese steak is lemme put it this way  your philly friends will approve the flavor is right  the bread is tender and fresh  and the ribeye is so tasty  7 bucks for cheese steak or korean food is really cheap the portions are big too i love this place  for lunch or dinner i usually get the bim bim bop  japchae  or sun dun boon   try their soups i know the names might be unfamilar  but on a rainy or cold day  it really warms the soul it reminds me of moms home cooking im not korean  but i can still see the care that went into the preparation of their meals  the atmosphere is very casual which is much appreciated in an increasingly gentrified ann arbor  no fancy attire needed the owner and his wife are wonderful people they were so welcoming and inviting to their guests i asked mr sim if he opened on sunday and he said no  we rest and watch a korean drama show  lol  the owners are such humble and sweet people they dont hire any help and its literally the two of them working all day long if you want to support local businesses  it doesnt get any more local than this,positive
flat out  mani osteria is amazing this place sets the standard by which other restaurants in ann arbor should be judged whenever i go somewhere else  i ask myself  sure  this place is good  but is it mani good   sure  sometimes it is hard to get a table here  but it is well worth it mani makes amazing pizza by new york standards i would rate its pizza as being comparable to co in nyc link httpwwwyelpcombizconewyork   all of the food here is delicious but the pizzas are outstanding  lovely thin crust pizzas with heavenly bubbly burnt bits on the outer crust they know what they are doing in that kitchen also  for my beerdrinking friends out there  they have a nice selection of beer  featuring rotating taps of michigan beers good wines are also available ive heard although i cant attest to that as kendall jackson is good enough for me in that domain   the staff is incredibly attentive and there are lots of them at first glance  it appears the place is overstaffed however  all of them are hard at work  attending to everyones needs and overall  making your experience great none of them are standing idly by waiting for something to do the whole seeminglyoverstaffed bunch is working hard  which translates well for guests   noteworthy ive been here four times now  and there hasnt been a bad pie  nor a bad experience  in the bunch that is significant while yelp allows reviews that are updates of a place  those review are few and far between so  most of the reviews that go into star ratings are of peoples first experiences  which we are mostly positivelybiased ive been here four times and each time it has been fantastic that goes a long way for speaking to how consistently great this place is   protip come for lunch  the weekday happy hour  or a sunday dinner  as its much easier to get a table then on fridays and saturdays the place is packed  and it can be near impossible to get a table within an hour   all in all  mani is just amazing all of the elements of this place come together in an amazing experience of great food and great times this is my standby place to go to when i want great pizza in a city with poor pizza options and  even more  mani is my standby place to go to get a great meal in a city with amazing food options   take home point if you havent been to mani yet  you havent yet had the best food in ann arbor,positive
excellent crepes  good  strong coffee  fair service  tough to beat we havent tried the rest of the menu yet  but i have no reason to believe it is any less stellar   probably the best brunch food weve had in a2  and among the best ive ever had even with the weekend crowds  we got a table in 20 min no reservations and were served promptly,positive
i find that i have less to say about the places i like the best   the atmosphere was very comfortable the staff was accommodating and attentive the food pizza  pappardelle  fig and gorgonzola salad was all fresh  with rich flavors  but light on the stomach the price was a bit high but i felt ok about paying it because i couldnt think of any way they could have done better   my background is italian so i am a pretty tough critic of italian food  but this is probably the best ive found in a2 and a strong contender even when compared to larger cities,positive

i love diddy riese their business plan is brilliant you can customize your ice cream and cookies to make an ice cream sandwich  you can get a customizable shaved ice id recommend the passion fruit syrup  pineapple and strawberry with the vanilla ice cream or just buy cookies cookies are freshly baked they are soft  and slightly chewy all of this with the price tag of about 2 bucks if you havent tried this place out and you have a sweet tooth  you should definitely try it out tips bring cash line is always out the door sometimes with really annoying young drunk freshman sloos who are annoying so be prepared,positive
omgeeee this place was great i got the chicken bacon ranch salad salad  lame i know and it was so good the chicken was fresh  juicy and seasoned to perfection  the portion was huge prices are modest i also had a side of the seasoned fries with fat sal sauce yummy i will be back to try the more fatty options fat sals has to offer ,positive
glendon is always a great place to go with friends my coworkers and i went for a happy hour celebration and service  food and drinks were great we had a blast,positive
mixed up burger with egg  onion rings  and an extra large orange bangthe end really  youll have a heart attack after this combo but very worth itstill hungry carne asada fries,positive
one of the stars of shack row starving after a lame party with too little liquor and too many douchebags stumbling home from oharasmaloneys seeking comfort latenight postbreakup come to tommy taco for some dreamcometrue fries   is it gourmet streetside food not really is it drool worthy eh what it is is a ucla  westwood landmark that is always there for me when im craving some hot  dirty   cheap junky funk food that flushes every minute i spent sweating at the gym far down the drain yeah i hate myself a little after weve wolfed down a majority of the plate and the fries are limp  cheese is congealed  sour cream curdled  and steak dries up  but those first forkfuls are the guiltiest pleasure even when you are sober and thinking straight,positive
i thought donuts were just donuts before i got a taste of stans now  for better and for worse  i know there is actually a difference in quality yes  its a bit pricey  but i am thankful for that as well otherwise id be spending the money on liposuction anyways satisfying texture with the right amount of sweetness my favorites are the old fashioned buttermilk bar and the pbj flavors will vary by time and day  so come in with your alternate choices lined up,positive
this is my favorite place to eat in westwood affordable  fresh  and delicious any way you want it i love the wowshis because the fillings are baked inside the pita dough and then cut in half blazing hot and feels like you get twice as much food once you fill up each hemi with your choice of veggies and sauces   this is basically a togo spot as there is only a small counter to eat at with about 2 chairs total i do wish there was more seating so i could enjoy my pita more comfortably  but hey  maybe standing aids digestion   heres my protip for the toppings grab a form and open up your pita and make sure all the meatfalafelbeans are spread evenly along one side grab your choices of sauce white sauce  hummus  splash of lemon  hello and drizzle from bottom of the pita to the opening then add your veggies love the pico de gallo this way  you get flavor from top to bottom  not just perched along the rim and watch out  these buggers are juicy make sure to have napkins and maybe even another wax paper to catch all the drippings   awesome theyre open after the bars close  too  because now you can pig out those pint night  amf induced cravings without feeling disgusting or breaking your wallet bella pita is the best,positive
after a 4 month hiatus from westwood  i have returned and had the pleasure of trying out napa valley grille for the first time we came in and sat down at a table near the bar it is definitely a classy establishment by westwood standards and a great place to go if youre trying to avoid the rowdy undergrads our waiter was extremely polite and helpful  knew the background and source of each dish and told us what was popular plenty of organic  local farm produced entrees  if you care about that kind of thing  heres a rundown of what we had sorry i dont remember all the fancy details of each dish  flatbread  14 for a small appetizer seems a little ludicrous  but mmmm was it delicious i was disappointed by the size when it came out however  after splitting half of it with my friend  i was already feeling pretty satisfied   scallops  12 order  again  tiny to the eyes  filling for the tummy two scallops on a bed of mushrooms  greens  and italian baconlike thing i cant name buttery soft juicy glorious   turkey bolognese  12 order  you should have seen the look on my dinner buddys face when he took the first bite pure pleasure need i say more  good food is one thing  but what really pushed me to put that 5th star up there was the service let me quote it back to you  me just water will be fine  thank you waiter would you like a lemon with that me yes  please waiter comes back with water  sans lemon waiter i forgot  did you want lemon with your water me oh  it doesnt really matter ill take it as is waiter no  your happiness is of the utmost importance it is no trouble to me to get you a lemon my first priority is that you are happy  maybe im being a sappy pushover  but when my waiter says that  he can have another 5 on tip and my phone number   it is pricey  but well worth it for the atmosphere  service  and food excellent experience,positive
my husband and i thought the food was fantastic nice ambience and service as well would definitely go back,positive
nom nommmmmmmmmarg argoooohhhhhshould i just keep making primal guttural sounds because these babies are insanely yum yum and cheap 150wow and you get to choose from multiple cookie choices and ice cream choices to make the perfect combo  or just get one cookie and a scoop in a cuplife couldnt get any better unlessyou open one of these in the bay area or they were fat free who cares the cookies were fresh and soft and the ice cream wellmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,positive
anybody growing up in southern california knows innout as a staple  and for good reason  this place has never failed me  and while no one should eat it everyday  i try to go there at least 12 times a month  the service is good  fast  and if you know the secret menu it makes things even better  if you havent tried innout please do  you will not regret it  my uncle once drove from texas to ca to get an innout burger  while it wasnt his only business  it was definitely a reason he stated for coming to ca  always and forever doubledouble animal style  and fries with extra secret sauce,positive
burrito believers  heres the thing  chipotle is where you should pray  for the price  quality  efficiency  it really just doesnt get any better than this   never never never have been disappointed at chipotle  that aluminum wrapped beauty is probably one of the best things i have ever held in my hands  eating the burrito is  of course  an art form  for these burritos are pretty giant sized depending on how much stuff you get they might even double wrap it  no extra charge though cause thats how they roll  heres my exact orderprocess of consumption 1 chicken fajita burrito please 2 just a tiny scoop of extra rice 3 chicken steak is also fantastic  as is carnitas very tender 4 corn salsa a must  medium salsa 5 a little cheese 6 a little sour cream  after you pay only 67 pick up a bottle of chipotle tabasco sauce and drizzle that stuff all over note  it might be smart to cut the burrito in half before eating and save the other half for later  chipotle is also very accommodating to customers  they have a bunch of secret items  like the quesadilla  and also you can also just order 1 taco instead of ordering 3  ask for another tortilla and usually theyll just heat it up for ya at no extra charge   my advice is there is no better bang for your buck than chipotle   oh yeah  their guac  while expensive  will probably make your mouth do the happy dance,positive
how can you not give diddy 5 stars 3 delicious cookies of your choice for 1 custom cookie and ice cream sando for 150 seriously what is not to love you just have to know not to go on certain nights where the line wraps around the block my fav late night treat place in westwood,positive
i love armandos truck he fed me many times while i was at usc the entire reason why i give 5 stars is because of armando who is the nicest person ever this truck puts a smile on my face and thats worth every visit,positive
great  interesting sandwiches  quality soups  really friendly staff all that and its amazingly fast too perfect lunch destination,positive
emmas probably doesnt need yet another review what more can be said about it consistently good  thincrust pizza worth the wait  a cantabrigian institution  everyone likes a certain type of pizza  and im definitely a huge fan of emmas  along with the spicy rosemary sauce its a little pricey for takeout unless youre just grabbing one or two slices  but eatin is a great value there can be a wait sometimesbut once youre seated  you never feel rushed and the people who work there are kind and patient  which just adds to the magic,positive
122307 family of seven for dinner  last night before they closed for the holidays parents are taiwanese  rest of us taiwanese american we enjoyed the food very much  salty crispy chicken  smoked duck taiwanese style authentic  alittle fatty  leave the skinfat on your plate  assorted hot pot with veggies  fish and clams  salt and pepper shrimp ive had better elsewhere  chicken casserole three cup sauce  very good and authentic  chinese veggies dohmeow  sauted fish fillet excellent  shredded pork with baby bamboo big ole plate of bamboo  great taste  even the rice was good   parking tough  grab any street spot you can make reservations  bro says it gets busy during peak periods,positive
122207 oh emma  my how youve stayed the same its been six years since i last saw you  you had just moved to this location from your original home in huron village  back then  you were just a secret your pizzas are still wonderful and light  still so healthy and delicious your menu still hasnt changed much  and youre still popular as ever im glad we had the chance to meet again,positive
i love toscaninis the way i love my mom  unconditionally and forever here was my home for the first few weeks that i lived in central square  a haven of delicious ice cream  hipster approved background music  and free wireless its my favorite goto place for some laptop time   the ice creams unique flavors  be it earl grey  burnt caramel  or any number of flavors is always at the forefront  never diluted by a taste of cream or general sugaryness exactly the way i enjoy my coffee   and i love brunch here too which is uncomplicated and filling i enjoy the creamy egg sandwich,positive
love of my life possibly fire of my loins if i had spilled that hot sauce into my lap but didnt   izzys is sweet and small with a good homey feeling that exudes from their generous  fulfilling plates to their plastic tablecloth covered tables plus they make their own soda too just as sweet but literally  and hello  plantains awesome banana deliciousness,positive
vegetarian alert  jaffa is not only about  shawarma and shishlik  you can get delicious  veggie and vegan plates and wraps here the hummus is creamy and tangy the  baba ganoush is nice and smoky  and the falafel is crunchy and garlicky and not at all oily the owners are friendly and chatty maybe some people dont that  but i do its part of the experience little middle eastern restaurants are supposed to be like that you go there to eat   drink coffee  and talk about whatever  with whomever  and listen to a lot of opinions its all good  and cheap  too we never spend more than 20 for  2  and that includes dessert,positive
im not sure how this is my first review of firestone  i mean ive only been here twice but i think about it often  my fianc introduced me to this place  because cal poly used to be her old stomping grounds  first thing i see when we walk up is a line out of the door  good for business and appearance bad when youre starving  haha but it was well worth the wait  full bar service sports for days on tvs galore and the tritip sandwich  mmmmmmmmmmmmm the tritip sandwich  i find myself trying to recreate the way they smoke the meat and toast the bread  whenever i have extra meat to play with that wasnt supposed to be adult in nature   stop in  eat watch tv get drunk eat some more take some home to eat for dinner  but then eat it an hour later because its that good,positive
id give this place 6 stars if i could  i love me some friendly family business  i love people being glad you were spending your money with them  ahhhh a falafel that is crunchy on the inside and moist and chewy and grainy on the inside  its making my mouth water as we speak  the pita was soo fresh and all the veggies were fresh and full of flavor  the pepperoncini was amazing  we also tasted the gyro meat lamb and beef it was super tasty  not too salty  a bit crispy yet juicy  they had 3 hot sauces which were my style giveem a selection  i like how you pay when your done  might not be a good idea if its crowded but more of a european feel maybe lebanese but i cant speak for them where its more about the food and your time then making sure you pay up front if that make sense  well start with im not into sweets and even less into baklava but damn if i didnt feel like a diabetic needing sugar  i could have eaten 50 of those things they were amazing  bad thing for you  i cant really describe the taste but really really fresh    strange that they are right next to the other med place in town petra  which i would try after frequenting jaffa more but the other place looked just fine,positive
i like fresh  creative friendly affordable places with people that act like they want you therehence the 5 stars   the beer special was 2 which kept me fully  the pizza was way tasty and the location was perfect to people watch  they had a cool vibe and the employees truly were nice and appreciated my patronage    we got 2 slices for there and a 12 to go  both were pepperonimushroom  both the pepperoni and mushrooms were extremely fresh  the sauch had a hint of sweetness  the crust was thin with a nice taste to it,positive
if metropolitan grill in seattle is my number 1 steakhouse in america  john thomas is number 1b everything is good here  from the service to the food every year  my acappella group came here for the senior dinner  and i looked forward to it every year we sat up in the private dining room and virtually every single need of ours was met by the staff they recommended wonderful wines to pair with the prime beef  and gave their honest opinions when asked about things on the menu i live in california so its difficult for me to get to john thomas  but everytime i am in the ole i town  i always make sure to make a visit to john thomas,positive
i lived around the corner from this place for a whole year and never saw it  its away from the normal foot traffic on westwood  gayley  et al  but its really  really good  tasty pizza  their lunch special is pretty good with the salad bar  nice atmosphere  it was never crowded when i went there  but the food is consistently good,positive
great food and one of the best people that ever worked in the restaurant business  get ready to wait in line  cramped spaces and maybe even ready to share your table with a complete stranger  but the food is worth it their dragon roll is great  any sushi is great the student menu is cheap and unlike other asian places very well made  have been going there for a while i dont mind the trek from cmu to oakland to go to this gem  try it once  you wont regret it  youll want to be back there the very next day,positive
i love this place and i always forget about it  its such an adorable spot with great hummustabbouleh and a sinful gyro platter  the best part about it is the outdoor patio  its simply adorned with those soft glowy light bulbs on a string and a bunch of potted plants  a wonderful place to sit with a magnum bottle of byob wine and watch ellsworth go by  the food is flavorful and inexpensive  and the family who runs it is very sweet  i wouldnt necessarily say it was destination dining  but i think anyone who lives in the area would be hard pressed to find a better casual spot to become a regular,positive
i cant stop daydreaming about gather,positive
my boyfriend and i are stuffing our faces with garlic naan and some ridiculously spicy mixed vegetable curry as i draft this review this place is intentionally kitsch and it looks like its having an identity crisis chinese paper lanterns and a pirate ship chandelier inside an antebellum plantation hotel building its like an acid trip  but i wouldnt know because ive never done acid  so im only speculating i probably wouldnt ever come here during the daytime but the food tastes delicious  and at midnight  what more could you want,positive
i literally highfived my boyfriend when we passed by the empty building today  so excited that theyre opening a maoz in berkeley we ate there in january when i visited new york and loved it it was a great value for the price cant wait cant wait cant wait,positive
5 stars go to the 100 organic salad bar and their wide array of vegan offerings yum yummmmm its 10 if you arent a student with a meal plan  but if youre smart you can get a friend to swipe their card for you for a school cafeteria  this is the bees knees,positive
a straightforward cup of drip is handbrewed by pouring very hot water into freshly ground beans into personal cups you couldnt get fresher unless you waited while the beans had been roasted lattes come in insanely mouth watering flavors  for instance the madame x  featuring earl grey infused white chocolate ganache  or even the handsdown winner  atticus finch  that contains vanilla with burnt sugar make no mistake these are no cloying  gimmicky drinks  but rather artful blends subtly kissed with flavor you wont get a speedy cup here and be on your way like perfection takes time,positive
just completed a dinner at charles kitchen in cambridge we stopped in because the smell outside was outstanding we had two different waiters and both were pretty friendly and attentive my friend had the guacamole burger and i had the beef tips  plus an appetizer of clam chowder every little thing was extremely good  in particular the clam chowder and beef tips,positive
have been back several times and just have to say that this is my new favorite cafe im in love the pastries are quite good and the coffee is tasty and reasonably priced  went today for lunch and it was wonderful the salads are highly recommended as is the mint lemonade just go  you will be happy you did,positive
their granola with fruit is top notch  their waffles are delish  we like coming here for dinner since the wait on weekends for brunch is ridonculous  as much as i like my pancakes  im not waiting one friggin hour for them  atmosphere is quirky  eccentric and funwelcome to cambridge friends  usually packed with lots of mit students  which is obvious when you start hearing the folks at the neighboring table start talking about semiconductors  mechanical engineering  and sht  while the service can be inconsistent at times  what can i say  i love this place,positive
oh falafel palacei used to live up the street from fp and ate there maybe 26 timesweek  it is hands down the best value for the  in the area  the food is fresh and delicious and you can tell them exactly how you want it eg extra hot sauce  less falafel more hummus and theyre completely obliging  i especially love the lentil soup  falafel wraps  and foule salad  while the service can be slow at times because it gets so crowded during lunch and dinner hours  for the price  you cant beat moodys,positive
this is  by far  my favorite sandwich shop  and thats saying a lot because quiznos is delicious    these sandwiches are simple  bread  meat  cheese  lettuce  mayo  but they melt in your mouth  the secret is the bread  they have the most delicious loaves ever  just the right amount of flake to the crust while still being incredibly soft on the inside  combine that with the right meat and cheese  and you have eight inches of sandwich perfection  all for just 425 a piece  i love the store itself  too  its clean and attractive  also  every time ive walked into the store  ive found myself nodding and singing along to the music they play  whether its the latest radio hit or an old favorite  but it will always fit into the broad category of rock  the music  the friendly  young  extra hip staff  and the little signs full of attitude all over the store  allow you to pretend for a moment that you are fighting the man by buying a sandwich here,positive
i cant say enough good things about jasons deli  it is so much more than just a sandwich shop  first  the menu is awesome  every single thing ive ever ordered here has been fabulous  my personal favorite is the california club  its turkey  guacamole  bacon  tomato  and sprouts  all inside a croissant  if you dont know what to order  get this one  they also make a mean reuben  if you like reubens  the awesome thing  though  is the extras  first  each meal comes with sides  i always get fruit with this awesome tart yogurtish dip  i enjoy this part of the meal as much as the sandwich  and  you can help yourself to all the little mini muffins you can handle  your choice of honey cornbread or a dark  i dunno  is it bran muffin  both are great  then to top it off  all the free softserve ice cream cones you want  i love the location here  rice village is just a wonderful place to spend time  and this restaurant has a little patio sitting area  but be careful  if you sit outside  never leave your food unattended  the pidgeons have turned into vultures  and will descend on your food the moment you turn your back   however  this is one more great thing about this location  very helpful and friendly staff  when the pidgeons got my lunch  they replaced it for free,positive
this is what ive been missing  no one told me how great toast is wtf  ha  saturday night with a couple yelpies we stopped in here around 1030ish for a small bite and some wine  small bite turned into a cheese plate and the shrimp and grits  i keep thinking about that shrimp and grits dish fantastic  i always picture sloppy breakfast looking grits  is this picture off base  yes  i also enjoyed how the wine is served with choice of the pourgives room to sample  i tried the chianti and it made me warm right up on a chilly night   last but not least the chocolate dessert  just magnificent  the waiter told our table that peeps come in just for that choc dessert  its that good  ill be back,positive
pastries  brownies  doughnuts  breads  cakes  cupcakes  cookies  danishes  muffins  and more  reasonable prices and fresh goodies    today was my first experience at prantis  bf and i walked in and it was packed but the wait was not long before someone asked what we wanted    my eyes darted back and forth trying to pick something  that was a challenge  finally after talking to the counter girl  my bf  and myself i decided to go with a brownie and a cookie  bf picked a doughnut  the bill came to under 4 bucks    the chocolate chip cookie was as thick as a blondie bar but bigger in circumference    the brownie was enormous and has walnuts in it    the doughnut was chocolate and vanilla frosted and my man ate it up within 2 seconds flat    addicting  delicious baked treats  the coffee cakes here with the white powdery stuff on top looked so good  maybe next time,positive
the food is the best bbq ive had in pittsburgh  the meats fall right off the bone and are just so juicy and seasoned well  they have 5 or 6 diff types of bbq sauce all with a little kick  the best side are the black eyed pees  amazing  dont eat inside take it to go,positive
my daughter and i go here all the time she loves the white clam sauce and i love the pizza i have had the lasagna too and loved itthe service is always great too,positive
amazing place  worth the wait one of the best steaks i have ever had the service was excellent and the atmosphere is great the french onion soup and mashed potatoes are amazing too  my son had the tenderloin tips and they were so good great place,positive
had the gnocchi with cream sauce  bruschetta and wine delicious im only sorry i didnt get a chance to revisit this restaurant before i left town didnt get to try the dessert so i cant review that,positive
this place is amazing  at first glance  the food isnt that much different from any other chinese place  except that they have their own farm and grow their own veggies  you wouldnt know from the prices though  its extremely reasonable  especially with the lunch specials  im mildly obsessed with their hot and sour soup  whenever im in the area  i get a large container to go  the bean sprout salads are very fresh  they actually sell their organic bean sprouts in the local super markets  look for chang farms brand   they have a daily specials list when you first walk in its actually what they have from the farm that week,positive
i usually dont like the doughy type of pizza im a new haven thin crust snob  i was hesitant to get a slice  but heard i had to try it  first off  they have an incredible selection  there are specials every day  they have some cool mexican style slices like black bean avocado  the crust is better than it looks  its also open late if youre looking for a quick bite after a late movie or drink  the people who work there can be annoying sometimes and they dont wipe the tables frequently enough  but its easy enough to take it to go or just deal with the crumbs,positive
this is the best chinese in the five college region the ingredients are always fresh and healthy  and the service kind my only complaint is it is a little expensive  but we have been coming here for five years and have a good time  every time i recommend it  especially in the amherst area  and miss it now that we moved in a time where chinese is typically generic  every dish here is a unique spin on the classics,positive
the nice bartender told me that the reubens here are excellent and he highly recommended it  i was hesitant because i never had strong feelings about reuben sandwiches one way or another  i looked over at the woman sitting near me eating her reuben  the appetizer portion  and it looked huge  she said it was the best reuben ever  it peaked my curiosity  so i was torn between getting an asian wrap and a regular size reuben with coleslaw  eventually  i committed to the reuben  but with a bistro side salad instead of coleslaw  as soon as i took a bite of the sandwich  i knew i had made the right choice  the bread was crispy  the pastrami was perfectly seasoned and tender  the cheese and thousand island were just the right amount  it was so darn delicious i didnt want to stop eating  my bistro side salad was very good toofresh greens with glazed walnuts and tomatoes and a light vinaigrette  i managed to control myself and ate only half of the sandwich and took the other half home  i pan grilled the other half the next day and it was still very delicious    i also tasted my friends french onion soup and that was really good too  there were big pieces of onions  lots of cheese  and a rich broth  the service was about a 20 minute wait  our waiter was friendly  overall  a very nice lunch experience,positive
great service  very clean and friendly staff i will return,positive
great food  great prices and i love the lowcalorie options that they give me  the fact that you can order online and not wait to come in and pick up your order makes this a 5 star place,positive
my new favorite yogurt place they have so many selections and a lot of tart selections probably the best yogurt i have had since pinkberry i also love that the business is connected to it the habit burger joint so you can enjoy a tasty burger  then  pick up a yogurt on the way out,positive
absolutely one of the funnest things to do on thursday night in slo town it is packed with fun people  vendors  and tons of good foods if you plan on eating dinner there i recommend the mclintocks booth they bbq amazing beef kabobs and ribs i am sure all there items are delish but i always get the same thing beef kabob  bread drenched in butter  beans  and lemonade its the best meal  just to die for all of the shops on the main stretch are open  along with the hands gallery  one of my favs to hit up i recommend getting there early to get good parking you will have to pay for most slo parking the parking garage is about 75 cents for two hours  not too shabby this is definitely a good time,positive
oh geeez im lactose intolerant but that never stops me from going to balis  the original fro yo heaven in my book when i visit home slo oh balis  how i missed you during those 4 years at ucdavis  the town with no fro yo shop lame how the summer after graduation they put 2 in balis has at least 6 different yogurt flavors and toppings galoooore reeses  brownie bits  snickers  heath bar  pokies true experts know these  caramelchocolate sauce and other fruitysour toppings for those of you who believe in mixing fruit with dessert personally as a chocoholic  if theres fruit in the dessert its too healthy and a fake dessert tip always  always put toppings on bottom  middle  and top of yogurt ugh i miss balis,positive
i swear the tritip sandwiches are bigger than ever and still  just as delicious i picked up two sandwiches before heading back up to san francisco last weekend i told the girl i was driving for 4 hours and she was so nice and helpful she had the cooks wrap up the meat  bread and sauce separately so it wouldnt get soggy during the drive and let me tell you  that night for dinner  it was delicious every bite just remember  always  always get extra bbq sauce theirs is simply the best,positive
i started frequenting pint night tuesdays at dog and duck two years ago i live a couple of blocks away  almost everything on tap is cheaper  the crowds are a good cheerful size  the bartenders are efficient yet helpful and theres always some fun people i have discovered most of my favorite beers at dog and duck under the tutelage of the staff   i have a porch fetish i love sitting outside beer in one hand  cigarette in the other  always an interesting sometimepassionate conversation dog and duck dd has not one but two massive porches one in the front one in the back    pint night was the entirety of my dog and duck experiences for about a year and then  last summer i went to spend a week in south padre with a few friends and that changed quiet a few things   the first was i tried food on the dog and duck menu as a direct result of going to south padre i will get to that story in a bit but in south padre  i also got the most uptight person i know to name my nuts it was a sort of personal challenge judge me all you want  but that poor soul now has an exciting story to share with all her friends for the rest of her life this one time  i went parasailing and i ended up naming my friends nuts i also went parasailing by the way  which was a little uncomfortable what with my fear of heights oh i also slipped through my harness and had a wedgie the entire time i was floating a few hundred feet above that island    back to the dog and duck menu on the way back from padre  we were driving by dog and duck it was open but not very crowded we went in  walked up to the bar and i actually picked up a menu from the pile at the bar that i had always simply and regretfully ignored  they had cheeseburger on the menu i love cheeseburgers so i ordered one  even though the burger and drink cost about 10 but there was nothing cheaper on the menu and the massive burger came with a massive serving of fries ever since  i make a biweekly foodfocused pilgrimage to dog and duck and overwhelmingly usually get a cheeseburger with jalapenos  fries on the side  a dr pepper if its too early or an ipa if its appropriate drinking time dog and duck has by far  the best cheeseburgers ive had in austin yes  better than huts yes  better than p terrys yes  better than sportini   the menu also features other great pub food items on the menu the queso is satisfactory the jalapeno poppers rock my world the fish and chips are good as infamous british food can get    i have taken a lot of friends and especially people from out of town to this almosthidden little gem austin has and theyve always come back for more my brother always makes a stop at dd everytime hes in town now  great staff  great selection of beer  great food  always interesting conversations and two orgasmically good porches dd is a great place to go for a few beers during the week or to satisfy a cheeseburger craving or to just to go for a spontaneous adventure,positive
shalimar is an ode written to the old country in the countrymans native language clay pit on the other hand  is one written in the audiences own familiar language  albeit written with a graceful mastery of the audiences language  by far  the clay pit is not authentic indian but i promise  this lack of strict authenticity is not a bad thing although  retaining a lot of the better elements of indian cuisine  the clay pit has incorporated some elements of afghani and surprisingly american cuisine  with splendid fucking results   with that preamble out of the way  lets get to the food if youre getting appetizers  you need to follow two rules dont get the samosas they are miserable  dry  blandish affairs definitely get the curry crab cakes also dont go to the clay pit if you are not going to be ordering any naan clay pit naan is lifeaffirming and dont just get garlic naan for the love of whatever you hold holy  try the other naans personally i wait for the day the clay pit decides to incorporate elements of fauxitalianslashamerican cuisine and already invent the naan pizza   for the main course  get stuff off of either the specialities of the house or vegetarian delight on the menu  for some easiertopick great fucking food if you dare to venture off of those two choices however  rest assured that most of them explorations will yield something pleasant if you feel like getting the korma  dont get the kabuli chicken instead its basically chicken korma 20 and thank the pretty waitress sarah for the recommendation  the lunch buffet  although a fun experience in its own right  is not the most optimal way to experience the clay pit you owe yourself better than that please   dessert id stick with the kheer everything else is meh however  be aware there is better kheer in austin   i think thats all the information you need to be armed with to enjoy the clay pit for some interesting trivia  keep reading otherwise  make reservations as the place tends to get crowded for dinners or show up for a decent happy hour all appetizers are half off and stick around till dinner okay  trivia starts in the next paragraph   naans are made in an oven made of clay hence  the name incidentally a lot of afghani bread is made in a clay pit before housing the clay pit  the address has housed a brothel and a grocery store as some of austins older residents will still remember  the grocery store that once was also has a horror story that some claim still haunts the clay pit this yelp review however  wouldnt be an appropriate venue to share the story google it,positive
this is a love story  trudys and i met when i was a freshman at ut i had a good first impression of this place it was an late lunch date on a nice thursday afternoon the fish taco touched something at the bottom of my heart  but i did not realize it back then i never really got a chance to know trudys better because as a resident on ut campus i had hundreds of dining dollars i had to spend at school cafeterias  later i fell in love with trudys because of the stuffed avocado with suiza sauce i was infatuated i could not get it out of my mind it was so good that i started taking all my outoftown friendsfamily members here at least once during their stays in austin  then  trudys transformed our relationship to the next level in january of 2006 i remembered that day so well because i turned 21 and i had the first encounter with mexican martini and cuban martini i can only say those are the most pleasurable drinks any restaurants can ever make for me  every time i visit  i discover more things to love about it during my lowcarb period  i learned that their steak fajita salad was of great portion  and with juicy beef strips and crisp vegetable during topshelf tuesdays  trudys encourages me to try out luxuries i normally would not dare to try with the upcoming summer  the additional outdoor seating help reduce the painful longing the socalled dreadful wait time  now trudys and i have a steady relationship i graduated from college  got a job  and practically moved in with the north star location on burnet and 183 it takes me 1 minute to get there we are really really happy,positive
best sports bar around  open and airy with tons of windows i hate the gloomy darkness of most sports bars  loads of tvs  good drink specials and yummy food that steps away from just burgers and fried nonsense the veggie quesadillas are so good the owner  managers and staff are laid back and very friendly and  biggest biggest biggest selling point of all  football  real unadulterated football not that american throw stuff love this place,positive
i do not have the vocabulary to say  the energy to extoll  or the fingercalluses to type how much i love zingermans  fresh baked breads  seas of gourmet cheeses  olives  deli meats  tapenades  pastries  coffees  chocolates holy heck the list goes on and on  and the sandwiches  my goodness  the sandwiches during the inevitable zombie apocalypse on earth  i hope to god i am in ann arbor so i can lock myself in zingermans and at least enjoy good food  even though the doors are glass and zombies will probably just break through them  it would be worth being eaten by zombies to glut myself at zingermans,positive
love  love  love malai kofta korma is my favourite  great as a date place if you get a table downstairs its all rough stone with arched  low ceilings if youre tall youll have to duck  dim lighting  very intimate you will want a reservation on any weekend night  unless you want to wait an hour or more,positive
need a festive place to take a bunch of bulls who dont get along  this is it  by the end of the night you wont know why you were fighting feel like you are a matador being served  and the new chef can really dish it up  the sangria goes down like a transfusion  the paella is worth the wait  if you have a party bring em in at 5pm  and you have the entire country of spain to yourselves  the spanish tortillas drive me crazy with love,positive
i am obsessed with the coffee exchange  their narragansett blend is just great it hits you like a freight train  its unbelievably hot  as if it was brewed in hells percolator  so if youre clumsy  ask them to pour a little out and save yourself an er trip  i love the atmosphere  the coffee and the mini cupcakes however  i do not love this one barista who does not smile  has no customer service skills and has the overall personality of a potato my girlfriend and i come here regularly and have had the misfortune of having her serve us each time her lack of pleasantries makes me want to scream  i digress  the coffee is great  watch out for the ogre barista though,positive
i have been coming to kabob and curry since 2003 i was an indian food initiate who was intimidated at the thought of nuclearhot curry slowly  i made my way through the novice dishes  chicken tikka masala and advanced to more intricately spiced and prepared dishes finally  after sampling literally every single entree on the menu please ask any of the waitstaff if you dont believe me   jai  the manager is unbelievably courteous and goes the extra mile i have watched this restaurant grow and my pallet has grown with it accordingly it has been a favorite for over seven years and i go there around four times a month at minimum and try to bring new people with me as much as possible  just go and eat  seriously,positive
my gf went to undergrad at brown and has known mike for over 5 years  but didnt know hed opened up a new store when we went in and discovered he was the mike of mikes calzones  he gave us free chips  soda and recommended things to put in the calzones  holy  these calzones are good i literally ate here every night for a week straight theyre that good,positive
this place is amazing if youre going for brunch  get the oeuf columbus its amazing  as are their crepes granted  it can be a bit expensive  but its so worth it  also the wait staff is a bit slow sometimes i tend to just order delivery  to avoid that  but if you arent in a rush  then eat in,positive
so good so  so good i lived in nyc for 3 years and never found any falafel that was even close to being this good if i could  id give them 10 stars,positive
love this place awesome waitstaff  delicious food  so amazing i tend to stick to either channa masala or vegetable korma as im a vegetarian  but its always spectacular their naan is great too,positive
i love any boloco  this one  the boston ave one  and the berklee one theyre not overpriced  and if youre looking for something mexicaneque while not too big on feeling like your insides are melting  youre better off here than someplace like annas their summer wrap is pure quality  and smoothies fuck  i missed the last bus home until 1am they close at 11 one night because i was craving a mango smoothie after a hot 30mi bike ride,positive
coconut rice has become a consistent part of my diet thanks to vp   i have never gone here outside of a passim show  but i would recommend you stick around for a lovely folk set   most recently they were without a pizza oven i believe they have one working by now and they serve sandwiches on iggys bread instead it was a damn good idea  i kind of wish theyd keep that on the menu their peanut curry dish turned into a sandwich was a unique  delicious new option,positive
i feel like i dont even need to review this place im a vegan as of the past few months and ive gotten quite used to oh  that looks delicious but i guess i cant eat it or oh  i guess ill just have them leave out the x  y  and z and im also allergic to soymilk just the milk so usually vegan ice cream is not an option either  i experience none of the above here everything is delicious and flavorful  either vegan or easily veganized  and filling it wont be quite as healthy as life alive  but i dont do yoga often enough to want to spend all my time there their coffee is decent as well  and they have pumpkin ice cream and all their ice creams are coconut milk based  which is fantastic  only quip is that they dont serve pizza on the menu they tell you that if you want pizza  go to their sister in harvard sq i say  either serve it or dont mention it at all dont tease us,positive
yelp keeps telling me to review this place since i checked in like  months ago for some reason forgive me if my review sucks  the things i remember most about the place   the interior decor was fantastic  great date atmosphere  and i remember seeing a closed off private group room that looked really cool  service was pretty quick it wasnt that crowded  but for a sushi restaurant it was impressive  i dont think there was anything wrong with my roll i got a special of some kind  it was fancy  pretty  and made my mouth happy it was kind of a spontaneous date and i remember taking pretty pictures there but managed to have them all disappear from existence  2 blogs  2 hard drives and all damn,positive
i love this place way better than felipesannas   the summer and mediterranean burritos are amazing  whoever invented  mango salsa is a god,positive
love does not begin to explain my feelings for daedalus   it is  by far  my favourite restaurant in harvard square    the highlight of the restaurantbar is the rooftop deck  there is no better place to be on beautiful summer day    the menu is excellent  i am a big fan of their fish and chips not greasy  waiters and management are top notch   while they have a good selection of beers  they no longer serve newcastle on tap which makes me tear up just a little  i guess you cant have your cake and eat it too,positive
more please  before i went to school at cal  i hated mexican  then i discovered la burrita  aka labo  food  the carne asada wet burrito enough said  service  fast  friendly  ambiance  quaint little place to have a bite to eat  and they have a nice little patio in the back  overall  go,positive
i love this place  you can get precooked dogs and buns to go  throw them on the grill on a sunday if you dont feel like going all the way out to berkeley  food  perfectly toasted buns and juicy wieners make my mouth water  service  fast  ambiance  its a small place thats always packed  but hey  who doesnt want a portable yummy treat  overall  best dogs in the bay area,positive
i love this place seriously the best burritos i can find in the area  they have a whole range of choices  to the point they even have a philly cheese steak burrito  i recommend this one  they have amazing combo meals as well   the decor is whatever and theres a usually a line  who cares  i love their food,positive
when you want some good chinese food  this place is awesome well  the place is called vietnam village  but it basically serves what i know as chinese food haha the owner is super nice the service is fast the food is cheap because the portions are huge its like 3 servings perserving thats awesome,positive
ohhh sooo good i literally went here everyday for an entire week  when i first found out about it the philly cheese steaks are amazing dont bother getting it with mushrooms  because you end up paying extra money for like 5 slices of mushroom also make sure you get it with cheez whiz yeah  i know  i was wary of it too  but i decided to give it a go  and wow  it makes a difference they also offer american and provolone  but neither of them stand a chance against the whiz they also have a little pepper bar  with different kinds of peppers  i usually get the big jalapeno slices  but dont add too many theyre arent spicy at all  but it takes away from the flavor of the meatcheesebread if you want spice  i recommend some sriracha sauce on that steak  it adds the perfect kick just know that i am extremely biased towards sriracha sauce haha  ive also had the crispy chicken sandwich which was equally as good as the cheese steak for days when you feel like something different its like a high quality version of the tendercrisp at bk dont let that description steer you away  cuz it really is good it comes on hoagie bread with a huge slab of freshly fried chicken  mayo  lettuce  tomatos  and onions  also  do not  i repeat  do not forget to get some garlic fries they are so good for only 2 you get an entire box full 50 extra for ranch  which i say is a must have with garlic fries  this place is also one of the very few places in berkeley that actually takes discover yay they also take amex for those of you who like to use that  make sure you dont around lunch time  cuz it is packed  you cant move an inch without bumping into at least 6 people ive found that the best time is to go around 2 or 3pm  when its completely empty,positive
i wont go here again the service was very slow and some of our food came cold  i had the shrimp from the appetizer menu and didnt feel good the rest of the night  this is definitely a miss,negative
i stopped at this place because they had a sign out front that said free free free  can of soda and a bag of chips with sandwich or platter purchase  ok  it got me  so i went in  ordered a sandwich  grabbed a small bag of chips off the shelf and a can of soda and went to the register  to my surprise  it rung up at 11  when i questioned the man he said the chips i had didnt count  i needed the secret crappy chips they had hidden behind the counter  ok  so then my total was still 880  oh  only the chips or the soda is included  not both  and btw  it clearly says and a bag of chips see photos  so i gave the chips back and said i just wanted the soda so he mumbled a new price i couldnt really hear and ran my card  i had to ask for the receipt and just shoved it in my pocket  so i get home and realize the receipt is for 880  really  shouldve taken those stupid chips  what a ripoff  and i check the reviews to find out that ripping people off is a normal business practice of theirs  only those reviews are conveniently filtered  did you know if you scroll down the bottom where it says 1 through x of x that there is a link to see reviews that have been filtered out  if you didnt you probably still dont  because i imagine my review will be filtered too  update i went back to the establishment to complain and they claimed the extra charge was not for the soda andor chips  but rather because i got my sandwich on a roll  like the other reviewer  the guy behind the counter offered it to me on a roll and i said fine i was never informed of the extra charge  but instead of apologizing for the confusion he offered to let me take the advertised bag of chips,negative
not sure what its like now  but was my favorite as an undergrad pizza was the best on campus salads were enormous   but honestly everyone should try to avoid it because they still dont use normal plats and silverware everything is disposable and for a school that takes a lot of pride in its greenness  thats pretty ridiculous,negative
wings etc recently opened up down the road from where i live  which made me excited to have a sports bar where i could catch a game with some hopefully tasty food and cold beer its a chain regional to the midwest and seems to have somewhat of a following  so what the heck  i went with coworkers on two occasions one  which i will briefly touch on  was to conquer their wall of flame challenge which involved eating 16 crazy hot wings with no food or drink success at the sacrifice of all taste for the next day worth it well  i did get a free tshirt  back to wings having worked in restaurants for a decent part of my life  i am critical when it comes to service  im not a jerk by any means  and i understand the concept of being busy  but there should be a good line of communication between staff and customer wings etc does not have this we waited 10 minutes for our waitress  15 minutes for our drinks  30 minutes for our food  and then 20 minutes more for her to bring us the check and then run our credit cards thats just not acceptable and the second time i went back  the service was just as bad not friendly  and way too long  as for the food  its ok the boneless wings are cooked to death so you get crusty nuggets and the traditional wings are a bit big because they are jumbo and have a large skin pocket on them that does not cook very well  leaving you with a flabby  fatty wing to eat the sauces are ok  much thicker than any other wing place i have been to  and most seem to have a tomato base so the sauce does not really stick to the wing  meaning the wings are a bit bland the fries they make are very tasty  but thats pretty much all i found enjoyable about the experience so sadly i will have to travel further down the road if i want chicken wings or a football game  because this place is just not working out,negative
bluefin bistro looks nice on the inside it has a great decor  that is the only good thing about this restaurant  i used to work in downtown lafayette  and one day the office decided to try it out  derailing ourselves from the most sacred taco tuesday at chumleys it took us about 30 minutes to be acknowledged for drinks by a ditzy waitress in a skintight uniform my water glass had a lipstick ring on it the cocktails are outrageously expensive for lafayette at lunchtime   upon ordering a lunch special  my seafood bisque came out with a giant piece of plastic in it it was obviously from the bag that the soup came in our ditzy waitress laughed it off  took my bowl  and never brought me another the sushi was marginal at best  my roll was falling apart  and the bento box seemed to have dried teriyaki sauce in it from another unfortunte victim of bluefin   when the meal was over  i was presented with a check for full price the manager was nowhere to be found to complain about the atrocious service and sanitary practices  or how many times our waitress said oooooops and laughed it off i will never go to bluefin again,negative
visit 1  food poisoned visit 2  food poisoned  two other friends visits food poisoning galore  does anyone see a pattern here  on a side note  ive only been food poisoned by cheese steak places in my entire life despite loving cheese steaks to death ,negative
i learned just today that the guy who owns the place kills wild animals for sport  leopards  elephants  bears  and other beautiful endangered animals on safari  truly disgusting  hes proud and brags about what he kills  and posts pictures everywhere of his trophies    httpwwwfacebookcomboycottjimmyjohns  oh yeah  the food is terrible  overprocessed ingredients and tasteless  like owner  like food  i suppose,negative
well  theres good badfood and theres bad badfood  this is the worst of badfood  the lowest quality food possible  while i like a good greasy spoon diner  this place is just horrible  absolutely gross  gave them the benefit of the doubt and went twice  but its a thumbs down from me  if youre 20 and very drunk at 3 am  maybe otherwise  stay away and keep an artery open,negative
food is only so so  making shepherds pie with beef betrays the inauthentic nature of the place   call it cottage pie or make it with lamb only  service was terrible  my friends and i will not be going back,negative
im not sure what else i can say about frogro that hasnt been said in summary  weird layout  incredibly inflated prices  rotting food  perpetually angry staff  the only plus  though  is that its open 247  which is convenient for us college students in university city if you need something during normal waking hours  though  and you have transportation  please make the trip to whole foods or trader joes  for your own good,negative
i came in here and politely ordered the banana with yogurt i asked if i could add granola  offering to pay for the extra item the guy at the counter  with brown hair and glasses  flat out told me no  we cant do that you have to get the other one the other one had berries  and i didnt want berries he told me again  that there was no way for me to get granola added to my dish which is exactly the same thing only without berries um  ok totally rude  its not that i was asking for something extravagant  luxurious or even unreasonableits granola   the coffee smells and tastes burnt  and the internet was so bad that i had to connect to starbucks internet   not worth high prices and snobby lack of service,negative
im a loyal customer of green house and it seems that the owner has been changed recently  the number of side dishes has decreased largely i only got four dishes and they came with very little amount we had two people dined in  the tv was not on the previous owner definitely wouldnt allow this to happen their tv is a big attraction for their customers   steam rice used to come with large amount now its likeflat  disappointing your stars will be decreasing more if you try to save more money on these details,negative
why is everyone raving about this place i ate there once  my first year in town  and have never gone back because i had such a terrible meal  fast and cheap  sure  but also tasteless  i recall eating something that tasted like veggies with gloppy brown sauce on it  it was served in styrofoam with a matted and mushy blob of white rice  maybe im missing something  but i was deeply disappointed,negative
go here only if you absolutely have to and i doubt you do,negative
okay  i say as i write this  cut them some slack  theyve just opened and theyre calling it a soft opening  trust me  it dont get any softer than this   first  if you think youre going to a real jewish deli  forget it  nyc its not it was bigger in space than i expected but feels more like a college cafeteria than deli   there is no ambience at all just a bunch of people running around without a sense of what they are doing  heres a breakdown of lunch  i had a lunch companion with me  you get seated and then the wait begins finally a waitperson comes up and takes your beverage order then you wait then someone brings you a plate of pickles and a pickled tomato  the bright neon green pickles taste as if theyve barely been brined more like a dunked cucumber  the dark green pickles are so brined your mouth puckers as you injest copious amounts of salt and garlic  forget the tomato  hard as rock and sour   you wait until someone finally comes and takes your order  they tell you up front it will take a while for the food to arrive because  after all  this is a soft opening  but 45 minutes for a corned beef sandwich and burger the corn beef was so fatty i sent it back  it was pure tee nasty and the waiter  who was from nyc  agreed with me the burger was okay  but the meat left a greasy taste in my companions mouth the potato salad had no flavor whatsoever and the potatoes were barely cooked  inedible the slaw had no seasoning either just cabbage  mayo  a little vinegar i think  and watery the buns on the burgers were monster size bigger than the burger itself and there was no way to compress it down to bite into it  so off came the bun and the burger was eaten as just meat on a plate you are served in picnic plastic baskets wplastic utensils  maybe that will change later  one can only hope so they are currently giving customers 50 off on all orders but they could give me 100 off and i wouldnt go back  i had so much hope for this place  i couldnt wait for it to open  i actually went to stams next door for a piece of chocolate to remove the greasy taste from my mouth  theyre much nicer in there as well  so  fellow yelpers  if you go to streets i wish you well  but if you are looking for real jewish deli food youre going to be disappointed    when the manager is asking me what whitefish is and how to prepare it you  feel as if youve entered the twilight zone,negative
we went on feb 15th at around 845 pm it was very noisy  crowded  packed but the food was sized appropriately we had a salad dishhuge  and chicken burger with fries    which came to around 25 including taxes and tips  we will not go there again because there were way too many tvs  we counted about 28 tvs in all  blasting away about every sporting event going on its a sports freaks heaven  not for us we didnt expect to have tvs blaring away during a meal  its either one or the other  its even uncomfortable thinking about it now  it was just too unpleasant the service felt more like an auction since no one was focused on making patrons feel comfortable meal times are to be enjoyed  not surrounded by tvs will not go there again even if someone paid us its not worth the money,negative
i went here for a work event recently  and all i can say is never again granted we had a large party  about 20  but wed called ahead we had one server for 20 people  and clearly she was out of her element three of the first eight orders brought out were wrong the food came out staggered  one woman got her salad  and then ten minutes later we got our appetizer  and ten minutes after that we started getting the rest of the food my fries were ice cold theyd obviously been sitting for some time the guy who asked for no cheese because he was allergic got cheese  returned the sandwich and didnt see it again until we were ready to close out our bill over half an hour later more importantly on a party of 20 i know they were charging gratuity we could not beg for drink refills  which was stupid on her part because most in my party were drinking beers or mixed drinks and before you think it was a rowdy bunch  it was my companies quarterly finance meeting  all accountants with an average age of 45 so our rowdy days are over it was so bad i was embarrassed and i didnt pick the place,negative
never  never  never  never again  heres why  the beef taco was very dry way too much salad on top  so i had no idea what type of taco i was eating poor customer service pricey  gave my bf and i a bad tummyache  overall i want my money back,negative
yikes even just walking by here you can get the vibe sketchy dive bar in the udistrict if youre into that sort of thing  it might be fun,negative
i came here looking for real sushi i assumed that given the prices  the fish would be fresh and the rice prepared correctly this is not the place to go if you want that  the nigiri was terrible the rice was gummy and poorly seasoned the fish was not fresh and was cut ridiculously thin in fact the mackerel was just plain horrible the rolls werent much better  but then again im not a fan of ridiculously overstuffed and over the top rolls this place just isnt for me i guess  the price is on par with other overpriced sushi restaurants i dont mind paying more for good sushi  but i just didnt feel what i was served warranted the price tag  im sure the drinks are great  im sure its a great place to be seen  im sure the free sushi on wednesdays is free but for well prepared sushi  this is not the place to come  not recommended,negative
after 91 years in business  princetons five star restaurant closed on friday  november 19th  three generations have managed this illustrious restaurant  which has feted stars and sweetsixteen parties alike  however  the world moves on  and after the building was sold to an investment firm  ml seven  owner joe christen decided it was time for him to move on as well  leaving this location empty for the foreseeable future  mr siegel  as president of ml seven  do you think you have enriched the community,negative
arrgghhhh i cannot believe it has come to this  im at a hooters and now that im here  i really cannot say why  except for a lack of options  and an excessively polyanna attitude  definitely  laziness and weather trumped the desire for excellence tonight  i do profess that i entered here with high hopes  but now i find that expectation excessively naive  beer first off  the beer selection is lousy especially bad considering the spirit of the times  when even the corner pub has craft beers on tap  and the food is pedestrian want to know what ales are on tap  expect a complete recitation of all draft beers  after all  ale and lager are just synonyms for beer  right  staff hooters claim to fame  of course  has historically been the waitresses god luvem  but i just dont care  delightfully tacky long ago became just plain tacky  the costumes are just plain ugly  from the support hose  the dirty white tennis shoes  the stretchedout socks  and the bulletproof bras  there is just nothing appealing about them  now  i will not paint the entire waitstaff with the same brush  but i do see a preponderance of pregnant substanceabuse victims here   to be fair  my waitress  tonight was attentive and friendly  even though she did flip out on the ale vs lager question  and then tried to convince me about what a great bartender she was the worst part was that when she was leaving and closing out my check  she threw away the charge detail  which meant that i could not expense the dinner company rules require a charge detail when i pressed her for it  she got quite snotty  and attempted to explain that in order to retrieve it she would have to dig through the garbage for it and i do not have to tell you what an obviously outlandish idea that was importantly  this occurred after i had written the bulk of this review  so her attitude did not really affect this  food the food is great  as long a you like it deep fried  and are not too picky as to things like flavor  visual appeal  or what sort of animal you are eating while previously known for their wings  these wings were just plain boring the hot sauce was hot without taste  and the chicken was stringy blecch  how can you go so wrong with chicken wings  positives  searching searching hold on a bit  still searching well  the beer was cold and you can be sure to get any beer you want  as long as you want bud  bud light  or coors light  and talk about inventiveness  who knew that you could construct most of a bar out of recycled plumbing equipment  there was free wifi  but the signal was so weak i connected to a hotspot from a neighboring establishment  specials kids eat free on saturdays seriously  its like a school sponsoring take a gun to class day  final assessment please  spare yourself  methinks definitely not,negative
this is not for the restaurant     we came here on a thursday night at the suggestion of someone that lives there  there was a nice crowd there but not really that packed  thats to be expected on a thursday  however  the people that were there were lame  lame lame lame    there is no real dance floorso as we are walking by  to get to the bar  we have to squeeze past a bunch of chicks in spandex and lycra blend rainbowwet sealbody central club fits on  all dancing with each other and one random dude in the middle  take away one star for that  we get to the bar and i order 3 washington apples  the bartender takes down 3 mouthwash sized wax dixie cupsi was thinking to myself  he must be giving me a sample  when he set them shots in front of me and said 33 dollars  for washington apples in a wax mouthwash cup  when i woke up from faintingi made sure that i told him a place with this reputation should not be serving drinks in wax cups  the most fun we had was taking pictures in the globe chairs they have  horrible  we shouldve went to 10 pins  geisha house gets a huge fail,negative
made us wait for 10 minutes to get a patio table  there was no one else waiting and 3 free tables  i figured they were going to make us wait a couple of minutes since being bitchy is their thing  but we actually had to wait 10 minutes  lame,negative
this is the worst thai restaurant ive ever been to the food is horrible and the service is also horrible  the place is packed  over crowded  noisy  and with very little room  the dishes are all the same  tasteless and lacking texture  needless to say since it is in princeton  it is grossly overpriced,negative
there are so many things that are wrong with blondies  the available seating is pretty weak because if you are traveling with a group you are essentially condemned to sit at a table that will intersect with the lines waiting for the cashier or their pizzas so for groups you pretty much have to choose carryout if you are eating alone then have fun sitting at one of the bar stools staring at a wall     the biggest travesty is how weak blondies pizza is the ratio of sauce  cheese  and dough is a delicate thing in pizza blondie fucks it up on so many levels i think its a combination of the shittylowquality ingredients and not enough sauce andor cheese the dough tastes really bad and theres too much dough and not baked enoughhonestly  i do not understand how people can keep on subsidizing this shit especially when better options cheeseboards  la vals  etc exist   avoid,negative
if you want box cupcakes with store bought frosting at 250 a pop served with a crap attitude this place is for you   if you like let downs for a sweet treat this place is also for you   if you want a great cupcake experience like magnolia or something similar to nyc i would recommend searching elsewhere  cause you aint gonna find it here  my friends and i sampled 6 cupcakes and are happy to report we will increase our savings rate by not spending money on cupcakes in princeton  if youre the owner reading this review stop skimping on your product and make great quality cupcakes with love and flavor and employee someone that cares to describe whats behind the counter to the customer  first time in my life ive thrown away cupcakes,negative
the food is actually pretty good and cheap   but because your service sucked so much ass tonight that i left  im bringing you down  le petit cheval   im the antientitlted american  and so for me to call out a place for bad service means there was some baaaad service baaaaad,negative
for 8 bucks i got a sub par philly steak the bread was weird with its soft texture the meat was not all that good i had to slather hot sauce over it to make it bearable plus they told me i needed a coupon to get the deal there were advertising i do not think this place will last long but i may come back to try their jersey combo sandwich should the right situation come along,negative
worst chipotle i have ever been to horrible service  very stingy workers  lard in my barbacoa  and to top it off  two of the top avocado seeds in my guac  go down kirby to main for the best chipotle under the sun  dont waste ur time  money here,negative
so overrated all the hype  to which the place doesnt really live up to  first of all  what kind of burger place serve their customer their burgers with soggybuns opening the wrapper within 5 min of leaving the shop  we came across with  quite mediocre  soggy  and allaround disappointing burgers  i didnt really think there was anything outstanding about it ok yes  its maybe just slightly better than mcdonalds but wow  the difference is really paperthin    my son  reading this review  exclaimed what i think mcdonalds better  he couldnt finish the burger  this is a telltale sign of failure but i give it that fg is ever so slightly healthier than mcdonald   i also should mention that  whoever packed our bag  put the fries in a cup upside down  well  thank you  a nice touch  i think glenwood pines restaurant by taughannock falls serves a burger x15 times better than this one  and the price is not all that different  as i remember   and potatoes from idaho cmon  that sounds so fresh  local and sustainable  that this sound enticing to most people with poisoned mind  is the problem of the  world today we need to all think about   the cashier and the guy who handed me the burger were young parttimers  just like mcdonalds  i find them sort of rude  especially the guy  when he refused to take my receipt since i didnt need it any more i also wonder if the same guy put our fries upside down  thumbs down all the way,negative
i got a grilled veggie panini like sandwich here not too long ago the veggies had that distinct  yet not so classic freezerburnt taste and smell  and were still a little cold in the middle they must have been seriously frozen in some cantabrigian tundra so as to still have an aroma of freezer burn even after being grilled it also took them like 15 minutes to make it that might have been ok if some chopping of fresh veggies was part of the prep  but grabbing a handful from the freezer to put on some bread really shouldnt take that long on second thought  it probably took a while to mostly thaw them  so that probably explains it the coffee is nothing special  your average grocery store brew  and the creamsugar area is always a crazy mess might suffice as an excellent hand warmer though  their sweets and pastries looked delicious  but not having tried them  i cant comment on them,negative
one of the few times i wish that yelp offered a 0 star rating choice ive been twice to this location and can say  without a doubt  that this is the worst restaurant i have ever eaten at first visit food poisoning had to jump off the subway and run to the closest possible restroom second visit two separate hairs two in my food as in ordered food  found a hair  sent it back  got a new order  found another hair  never again this place is filthy and disgusting,negative
ive tried the organic karat carrot cupcake and cappucino cupcake yes ive been there twice despite my low review  the second time because i wanted it to be good so bad haha  but no  they continue to disappoint the cake is dryy and the frosting is way too sweet and strangely dry since when can frosting be dry terrible cupcakes,negative
wtf a terrible ending to a terrible visit to the worst city ive ever been in i went to philly for a college visit  which by the way im definately not attending because i hate philly it was my first time there   i was starving because i hadnt eaten all day and every food place i saw looked like greasy crappy philly cheesesteakesque foods i saw this place  recently renamed kiwi yogurt or something  and i also  being from new york  assumed it was a pinkberryred mango type thing now i love pinkberry but this was the worst piece of shit ever i dont know what it was  it wasnt even yogurt the part that pissed me off the most is the fact that it was so expensive  even though i only put a few toppings on  a small serving of yogurt it came out to 10 when it was weighed are you kidding me 10 for yogurt  literally i was like what the fuck in front of the cashier  but obviously i had to pay and then two other newbies came in and unknowingly loaded up their cups because im sure they assumed 49 cents per ounce was really cheap well theirs ended up to be 15 fifteen bucks per cup   this place is a complete ripoff and for the same amount you can get at pinkberry  you get a cup of dung for three times the price wowww philly,negative
so my omelette was oozing with oil  my hash browns had what was either  clothing fiber or cat fur completely cooked into them and my supposedly awesome root beer was watered down and warmish despite the stupid frosty mug  to their credit they subtracted my meal from the bill  which is cool because i couldnt eat or drink it  but my friends peanut butter burger looked pretty awesome  even if he was disappointed with his shake  would it hurt the cook to wash his hair,negative
this is honestly the worst starbucks i have ever been to hands down  and for some reason i always am willing to give them another chance i think well its rush hour and i may be able to get a drink here a little bit quicker than down the street at crema or i dont have any cash on me so i have to go somewhere that takes cards so i pop into starbucks for a lattealways a huge mistake  i have never been in and out of here in less than 15 minutes even when there isnt a line which is honestly ridiculous considering i can get a drink at the central square starbucks in less than 5 minutes with 10 people in line in front of me there have also been times when they have forgotten that i ordered a drink even though im the only one standing around waiting for one and ive also been outright ignored by two people standing at the cash registers they were too busy talking with each other to acknowledge me and i just had to walk out   if you need starbucks in harvard square  the one in the garage is much better and crema cafe is just around the corner but dont waste your time with this starbucks i wont ever again,negative
this places ice cream pales in comparison to that which you can get at jp licks and christinas ice cream shop  cheap tasting ingredients,negative
i have no idea why people give this place good reviews there is absolutely nothing special about theloniuss rolls besides perhaps the clever names they give them in their menu the rice is not cooked well as in  i believe it was overcooked  their ingredients are not fresh  and the service isnt great service was slow when we got there we also tried their miso soup which wasnt even good  it had a slightly sweeter taste  which was bizarre and really  how can you even mess up miso soup   lastly  it is clear the owner of this restaurant cannot handle the criticism and asks his friends to actively berate and bully yelp users who attempt to provide their opinion of the restaurant ex a yelp user messaged me with youre fat her first review on yelp thelonious monkfish  five stars listen  it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure that one out,negative
i got here through buywithme  10 for 20 voucher  the waffles i was very disappointed with the quality of the waffles  and ive definitely had better they were extremely doughey  heavy  chewy  and one of them was slightly raw in the center the size of the waffles was also disappointing  im a small girl  but even i had to eat at least 15 waffles to feel full  the service slow hectic loud rude because the size of the space and the great number of customers pouring in  they want to ensure that you dont idle too long at your table once you are done with your meal which is fine but whisking away plates and utensils that you are still using is not fine  and it made me uncomfortable and pressured me to eat my meal faster  the management rude yells at their employees i understand that dealing with a lot of customer traffic can get overwhelming  but they didnt know how to handle it professionally and calmly  the price overpriced not an improvement from the creperie that once occupied this space  the only good thing the decor wasnt so bad i really liked some of their fancy cushioned chairs they had  very european wasnt a fan of the metal chairs though,negative
i know one place i will not be returning to when i visit our rpi guy  unless im coming to watch a swing or tango  i really have no reason to return  i checked in with my fellow yelpers upon hearing our sons recommendation and made a reservation to enjoy what he felt were great drinks and memorable bruschetta assuming the food would follow suit  the martini was a disaster  his gin and tonic was tonic infused with gin  and we had the worst prime rib and mashed potatoes ever  do not bother to order the carbonara  unless you enjoy pasta cooked al chef boyardee mush and obnoxious amounts of cream  its more a mush meets alfredo and had a bad date  interesting architecture  boring service and food that quite frankly wasnt worth the paper our bill was printed on  save yourself some dead presidents and order pizza in or just go dancing  stick with water  and get your high somewhere else in town,negative
great bartender  wonderful but horrendously overpriced wine list  i have to say  we didnt stay for dinner and went over to temple downtown after trying the worst carpaccio ive had in a long time  they over populated the dish with arugula  shaved parmesano reggiano was ausente  but my goodness heavens  they freeze and defrost the meat and it has a bland spongy texture  yuck  shame on such a beautiful restaurant with a nice little bar with personality  shame on you,negative
the most overpriced  undersized burger youll ever eat  the only reason its not the crappiest burger youve ever eaten is the sauce they put on it  they could put it on an old sock and it wouldnt taste half bad  theres plenty of greasy burgers in la  and a person shouldnt be forced to fork over 12 bucks for a meal that has a worse chance of being delicious than the jonas brothers do of being considered real musicians  shouldnt the prices be less since its old  theyve got the nostalgia market cornered but continue to price their food like its on sunset  too small  too mediocre  too expensive  and too ridiculous to even consider if youre not a retired investment banker,negative
not so good noodles were over cooked and pad thai very sweet,negative
i have no idea why this place is still open its a total dump the only people who get treated like humans here are arabs and persians i am not being racist at all i saw it with my own eyes i have been here on two separate occasions with some friends   i dont even know where to begin  a there is a minimum limit per person charge i believe its 20  bthe furniture is falling apart there are burns in the furniture from cigarette ashes and food stains  cthe floor is filthy and sticky   dthe restroom is filthier than a restroom at a truck stop  e the wait time for a hookah and or food is ridiculous  well that is unless your of middle eastern descent i witnessed this four times we had persian kids come way after us and they had there hummus and drinks two minutes after they sat down we waited 30 minutes just for hummus and water  and they forgot the pita bread agh  f the staff and owner are a bunch of greasy slick guidos they overcharged my friends card and left it back at the register while we signed the bill  g when the food actually arrived it tasted horrible my friend and i shared a dish we only had two bites and left  h the hookah tasted horrible it was to harsh and flavorless  i i doubt they thourghly clean the hookahs if they cant even clean the floors i doubt they clean the hookahs    if you want good hookah go across the street i dont remember the name  but its next to diddy riese    so enter at your own risk,negative
i had eaten here once of twice when i visited friends in la years ago i dont remember what the food was like  but liked the oldschool decor and its 24hour service   apparently years later  when i visited again as a sober being in the day light  the experience is entirely different my husband and i wanted to get something to go before we head back to sf we both got the egg sandwich  the cheapest thing on the menu  which were like ten bucks each i dont think any breakfast item price should exceed a single digit unless i am eating crab buffet in a posh hotel listening to live jazz   but anyway  price inflationwe are in 2009everything is more expensiveblahblahblah we did exit the restaurant with two hefty boxes that would sure keep our bellies full for the next 8 hours   unfortunately  the sandwiches sucked i couldnt tell the ham from the french roll to the cheese to the scrambled eggs it was just a blob of grease and the giant portion of potatoes tasted just as oily and gross   i dont get it  being in westwood  a college town  where cheap good food should be abundant  who do they sell such expensive bad food to,negative
this place is for pseudo intellectuals  trying to get laid  but too smug to show 1 of interest in anything that contains a molecule  it takes forever to get a drink  its expensive  there is always an abomination of a band playing  which usually consists of a dude with a giant beard  a tambourine  a homemade noise machine  and an acoustic guitar  apparently vegetarians come here to eat the horse shit they call food god this place blows  i came here and suddenly was overwhelmed with the urge to drink extra dirty vodka martinis  what kind of prick drinks that shit come here for one reason  to come to the realization that you are in fact an uneducated  poorly dressed scum bag  and thank fucking god  now lets go to god damned characters in pomona,negative
several friends recommended this place to me as having great seafood  so i had to try it out  i ordered oysters  and grilled trout and my companion ordered 12lb lobster lazy man style  this place gets 0 stars for food and 5 stars for ambiance  i averaged it out to 1 stars because the poor quality of the food outweighs the lovely setting of the restuarant  to start with the ambiance  they have great outdoor seating in the summer and live music  its a great place to kick back  have a drink with friends  and just enjoy the summer days   moving on to food  the reason that this place gets 0 stars in my book is because my companion and i started out with oysters as our appetizer  they were nicely presented and our waiter was really great at explaining the differences between oysters from different ports  etc  however  5 hours later that night  both my companion and i were retching over the toilet throwing up from the food  it was terrible and i wouldve expected a nice restuarant like hemenways to have cleaned out their seafood better    i called the place the next day to complain about the food and how it made me sick up all night throwing up with an uneasy stomach and the person i talked to on the phone basically shrugged us off and kept bouncing us from person to person  all in all  i did not get any apology or even an awknowledgement that our opinions valued,negative
epic fail  yesterday  i looked at the reviews and decided to post a fourstar review  as i headed over to zorbas to meet a few outoftown friends why such a bad rap i thought  and figured id help boost the reviews of this place that id been to twice before  and enjoyed  well  i went there yesterday for lunch today  i woke up deathly ill  and proceeded to kick off 2010 by vomiting nice  im still sick but my family is taking care of me the three of us had different items  not sure what took us all down  but we suspect zorbas as we all went our separate ways and are all deathly ill today  now i will add that im sure they run a good business and are decent people but food poisoning is the one thing that cannot happen when you run a restaurant i will touch base with them to see if they will do anything for us,negative
moonstruck is definitely not my cup of tea the prices are outrageous  the selection is not great  and they are probably the only coffeehouse type place that does not have wifi by now it is just too snooty for the common student looking to get a beverage or something sweet  oh and as i type this  i just remembered that the last time i was pulled in there by my fiancee because she had to have something sweet i went to sit down in one of the big chairs to wait for her and there was melted chocolate all over it not cool,negative
for the 1000s that forward my reviews  ok  one  you know i consider a good restaurant is a place with a good bar food is relevant only if free during happy hours i left work early and ended up at the outdoor bar at legal at the charles hotel what a great day  and there was a hottie at the other side of the bar that made it even better i got a beer to start my long stay then it happened  the bartender started first  yelling for tommy  that must have been in china then singing way too loud to the music playing with the itouchthen commenting to everyone else working there on   omg another stoli  oh god  i made sooo many of these last night  blah blah blah limp joints that seemed to flap in the breeze ok  i am not homophobic  but look  this bar is not a set for a drag musical it is a place to make me comfortable me not to entertain yourself mr bar keep  i left after one beer even with cleavage from that hottie in my face  i could not take this unprofessional jerk,negative
a friend and i went in for a nice lunch after walking around and not finding anything much better we immediately liked the ambiance  as it had a scottishpub like feel to it  almost we sat down  excited to see what the food would be like  i ordered a chicken sandwich  and my friend got a roast beef sandwich my sandwich was literally two pieces of slightly buttered bread with some slightly undercooked pieces of grilled chicken breast stuck in between it i ordered lettuce and tomatoes with it  and it came on the side with only enough for one pieces of the sandwich i shrugged that off and ate it  just because it was pretty cheap and i didnt want to be too picky  then we saw our waitress drinking a glass of wine at the register  we didnt say anything at the time  so as not to be troublesome and whiny  but i did call them a few minutes later and asked to speak with the manager i told him about the situation i tried to be very nice and his response was  yup we were just tasting a house wine k  like it was my fault one of his staff members were drinking  and it was not just a sample  i dont have a problem with drinking obviously  but doing it on premises  and right in front of the customersi mean  sheeshshe couldve at least made it into the kitchen  needless to say  im def not going back there,negative
brought some out of town guests here for some fresh new england seafood and ended up having a down right nasty experience  the prices are ok and the seafood was tasty if standard  my fried seafood plate was surprisingly large  fresh  and varied  but here are the negativesand i mean the ruinyourmeal kind of negatives  as a table of 9 they sat us in the long booth in the back by the kitchen  throughout the meal there were fruit flies everywhere  not a plague  but certainly enough to be unpleasant and in your drink  but the green wormy bug that one of us found coming out of a fried scallop was enough to ensure that wed never return  oh  and they charge for soda refills,negative
one word this place isnt so good  after a night out at noir  see previous review  we decided to come here instead of getting shawarma unfortunately  it was 2 am so all the drunkards came in from the other local establishments it was really loud and people were obnoxious and honestly it made me really uncomfortable and irritable  the food is also standard ihop quality many calories  really heavy  really filling  and not very good two of us ordered their chicken and waffles and it was likened to something worse than something from a tv dinner   anyways  this started a search for reasonable chicken and waffles in boston  hopefully we find some  edit we tried coming back here at 330 am one night since nothing else was open  but they refused to serve us even though they close at 4 am because they were washing the carpets an unfortunate ending to an unfortunate decision to attempt to eat at this unfortunate establishment,negative
this gotta be one of the worse and unhealthy places in the whole world  our server was smoking right in front of our table with the entire staff and completely ignored us every time we need it something hows the 020 tip now we will never go back  stay away ,negative
the worse service and cold food i had in a long time management  a dish washer can do a better job  never again not even for free ,negative
i am giving it a star because of the fact i am amazed it is still in business  honestly it is not barbeque  it is food that sits under a heat lamp and tastes like it belongs in an high school cafeteria  it is the only bbq place in the area  but i highly recommend you look yonder if a bbq craving hits,negative
lousy menuboard italian food place fifty steps behind basta pasta and maybe a half step above the gold standard for bostonarea italian culinary failure mikes in davis square  the first thing you might notice  after you squeeze by a person or two to get to your table  is the nice failing suburban pizza place motif  then you get your menu and see prices at or a little higher than olive garden or basta pasta  setting your hopes appropriately until the first morsel hits the table    in our case that first glimpse was salad  a spread of lettuce with some notallthewayslicedthrough white onions  tomatoes  and huge chunks of cucumber  on the side a little plastic cup of red oil they call raspberry vinaigrette  garlic bread  a lot of it  not so garlicky    we both did the make your own spaghetti with various vegetables  tomato sauce  and i got sausage  the vegetables were just thrown in thoughlessly my onions were giant rings placed under the spaghetti and the sauce was typical lowquality watery peppery crap  boooooooo  locationreliance,negative
the subtitle for this restaurant should be  home of the burrito of infinite regret  both my girlfriend and i were sick after eating at this spot the burrito was large  but the meat was dry and the guac tasted terrible  all in all  we would never  ever go back funnily enough  we also noticed that it was named ris best mexican grill we have decided not to return to ri for any period of time weak,negative
i was drawn to university market for the subway i no longer go to university market because of the subway  ive never had a worse sandwich created than by the staff here you get the feeling that they really  really hate you for being a customer the bread is always underproofed and limp  and the sandwich artists rarely listen to what you want  and when they do  seem incapable of remembering more than 1 ingredient you ask for at a time  if you order a sandwich from this subway  be sure to watch like a hawk  because youll end up with jalapenos  dijon mustard  and nothing else on your tuna sandwich if you dont topper you have to ask to get your sandwich cut in half come on  as for the market  its not bad  with a decent selection of goods  beer  etc they now have a 5 minimum purchase for a credit card   avoid and save your love of sandwiches,negative
bens roomate posting  beautiful atmosphere  perfect music  2am license in cambridge  lovely hotel horrible service  went to noir tonight with my girlfriend for the first hour of my birthday  sat down in a romantically lit leather corner  we approach the bar as the only server around doesnt seem interested in our business  though she serves the table next to us for our first round  a scarlet street champagne signature cocktail and a house sidecar  scarlet came out fine  but my the bartender dumped 2oz of champagne into my drink to compensate for the 2oz pour  next round belle de brillet on the rocks and a naughty opear  the bartender delivers the signature cocktail whose second ingredient is supposedly belle de brillet and informs me that they cant pour my rocks drink because theyre out of belle de brillet  with the cool atmosphere and ambiance  if noir could get its cocktails and service down  they could be the coolest spot in cambridge  until then,negative
tommy doyles has such a great ambiance  the lights were dim  the style of the room was great  unfortunately  the food made me want to leave immediately stay away from any of the burgers  however the beer was great  it dulled the pain of dealing with the service  my waitress was so rude  she had shifty eyes  they were really shifty  the only reason a person should visit tommy doyles is to grab a nice little restraunt horror story,negative
not sure whats worse  the bands  the bouncers  the food or the customers   i would skip this nightmare unless you are in the 1822 age group,negative
weak,negative
oh my god this place serves awfully bad food and provide equally awful service  the sirloin steakhad lots of fat attached to it and it was dry the plate was so small that the food was falling out of it not because there was too much food  but because there was a ridiculously small plate  the outdoor seating was the only nice thing about it even their warm drink by the time they get to you is very cold  i will never go there again  and they have two bathrooms  but they are either  or and both are extremely gross why the hell would they do that i dont get it,negative
my first time there today for lunch  im sorry i even bothered  while the atmosphere is great  the food is terrible  i ordered the black bean soup it was grey  yes grey  it was watered down with vinegar so the sour cream curdled in it  the cuban sandwich looked as if it was taken from a box of frozen sandwiches and the ham was spoiled  needless to say i walked out  dont bother going there if you want to eat,negative
rachel ray are you on crack  well i swear i saw rachel ray from the show 40 a day go to this place and rave how the food was delicious and great price first off i find her show to be really annoying and the only reason i was watching was because she was doing boston   so on a nice day a friend and i decided to grab lunch on the outside area located with a view of that lil park area well we decided on burgers and gooosh were they pitiful the meat was very low quality over cooked and down right nasty the only way we could force down some of it was by literally covering it in ketchup also no french fries just some plain chips despite being the best thing on my plate i assumed for the price they could hit me up with some fries  my suggestions are go to basically any other place in the area and you will be happieron our way out i did see one guy who seemed to know how to order in this place and that was just a beer and a plate of chips   man this place is such a waste of space and rachel ray needs to lay off the crack,negative
hmmmm wat can i say it was an experience   well i randomly ended up here one night  i didnt eat but the food seemed just like any other chinese take out place  i swear they use a standard menu which all takeout places must conform to   but i did go to the bar area and shared a scorpion bowl with friends  i thought those things were supposed to be strong any hoot we finished the bowl and opted for some straight alcohol instead which was being served out of what seemed like a closet upstairsalil sketchy  after being fully liquefied a few of my friends decided to come join us his first response over the phone was what the heck ok we will call when we arrive  once he arrived his response was hey were the only asians in hong kong  which i found rather humorous but could have been the fact that the closet was making some decent drinks   basically i havent been back  dont really plan on going back  and i defiantly learned its not always about where you are but the people you with that makes the night fun,negative
the food and drinks are not worth it  all they had for white wine was a blah blend  i got the shrimp skewer with pineapple salsa and it was horrible  the shrimps were really little only came with three and the salsa was nonexistent literally  i had a hard time finding it on the plate  the weird thing was  it was served on a tortillaso after i ate the shrimp  i had this tortilla to eati felt a little awkward just eating a plane tortilla but since this is what i ordered for dinner i had to eat it  safe to say i will never eat here again,negative
disappointing flavor aside there are no excuses for bad cooking our chicken drumstick appetizer was undercooked the rice that came with my entree tasted stale and my salmon was definitely not fresh we didnt have dessert the atmosphere was nice though,negative
ive been to mayfield both for lunch and dinner  both times i walked away feeling underwhelmed    first  the prices are high for what you get  with the abundance of competition in palo alto  including a fabulous restaurant right next door  its hard to understand why mayfield does not offer more competitive pricing  secondly  the food is just not very tasty  i recall the pancetta pizza in particular  it tasted really bad  third  service is lacking  waiter did not check up on us and we had to flag down someone to clear our plates and bring us dessert menus  after dessert menus were given to us  no one came back to take our order for another 20 minutes  at that point we really just wanted to leave  lastly  towards the end of the night they offer complimentary bread to their patrons  not sure if this is the way they go about getting rid of their breads  i thought this was a very nice surprise  but found the bread to be super hard right when i got home  i mean  seriously  no oven or microwave could have made this bread any softer  all in all  mayfield was a disappointment both times  i would not recommend this restaurant at all,negative
i remember this place being a lot better than it was last weekdid they change ownership at the guadalupe location,negative
i dont understand all the hype about this placethe watered down and extremely sweet bubble tea to the sauces that seemed like marinades for overcooked veggies and a bowl of bland and overcooked brown rice the servers seemed like robots without emotions and smiles and i almost got sick from eating here the 50 items on the menu are enough confusion to begin with the spicy is a mild at the very best wont go back,negative
even though im not a fan of the hookahs  i do enjoy stopping by kasbah now and again their chai is delicious and the music is great the only downsides are that ive never been able to sit inside but the cushions do look comfortable  and that the huge chain video store across the street kind of ruins the view  edited nov 2007  i found out the other day i havent stopped by in a while that this place now makes getting a hookah mandatory as someone who a doesnt smoke and b doesnt always go with friends who smoke  this seems pretty stupid im not paying 14 for a hookah so i can hang out and enjoy the chai  thank you very much my rating just plummeted,negative
i sentence damon  pythias to yelp jail let me state my case  i went to lunch this week with the hubs and we ordered the simplest foods in america a tuna salad  sandwich and a hamburger my honeys hamburger had iceberg lettuce which wasnt a deal breaker but  based on preference  i think its as tacky as wearing plaids and stripes lettuce snobs  stand up  their serious offense putting fennel seeds in my tuna sandwich why would anyone do this is this common how long has this been going on give me green apple  cranberries  relish  anything but fennel seeds i hate fennel seeds in grumpy smurf voice   please remand damon  pythias to the custody of yelp jail what im a law  order fan ,negative
why did i decide to try this place again  still not goodi think this was definitely my last visit everbut they are still very nice,negative
if youre living off meal points and youre in need to waste them  this is might be your dining location of choice at berkeley if not  then i would advise you to save your money and stop at walgreens or one of the restaurants in sproul plaza there will always better a cheaper and tastier option than the golden bear cafe  the sandwiches are probably the best deal here  theyre toasted and include a relatively generous helping of deli meat other than that  the salads are not bad although it depends who is actually making them behind the counter with that said  you can get much better for cheaper about two blocks away  be it at sufficient grounds sandwiches or cafe mattina salads and sandwiches  the place is generally packed with freshmen and sophomores in between 11 am and 2 pm  meaning that you have to wait in line for about 15 minutes to get your food  10 minutes to pay for it and 5 minutes to find a seat outside provided  of course  that you dont want to sit next to a homeless man,negative
i went here for a happy hour during a weekday    the only things i can remember out of this experience were cons too loud  i could not even hear the person across from me pretty expensive since tapas only come with a few piecesand you need a few orders to get you full parking sucks but that goes for most rice village restaurantsstoresbars  the foodnothing special for me to remember    i left with the thought that i dont plan to really come back,negative
not very knowledgeable staff  slow service  food is edible if you dont care what it tastes like  tho convenient location but i would go elsewhere there are a few better japanese restaurants few doors down   i have noticed a trend here  most people who give really good reviews about sadako seem like those who dont know betterno offense  but how much should i trust those reviews from the people who appear to be a bunch of college kids i asked myself  so i gave it a try  their spicy tuna is horrible  despite the fact that too many reviews give them two thumbs up  still  it is horrible  what i taste in their spicy tuna seemed to be a mixture of vietnamese chili sauce sambal and maybe sriracha sauce if they even knew that it is the sauce originally from a region called sriracha in thailand the spice that they put in there masks all the tuna taste that i couldnt even taste tuna   that may be why so many people like it  they cant even taste the fish  tonkatsu is way greasy and the pork was over cooked it was tough and chewy the tonkatsu sauce is obviously one of those cheaper brands with a strong vinegar taste and when i asked for ponzu sauce  the waitress didnt even know what it was how they pick their employee is very questionable   in short  if you look for easy overpriced nonauthentic very americanized food they call fake japanese  go there you wont be disappointed  but if you pride yourself to be anything else more than that  dont ever go there i made this mistake twice  but there will be no third time,negative
no thai serves no thai food  this is exactly how i feel about their food  pad thai is hard to make good  but it is not that easy to screw up they way they do it at no thai yes  i find it funny that  makes much more sense in this sentence  i love thai food and i can take quite spicy and i know thai food well enough to the point that i can say that  the food here is horrible  i am openminded so i gave them a try for a few things  the few main things that it is a shame if they screw up while claiming to serve thai food  i had pad thai  what did i get some chinesestir fry noodle with nothing  zero things that resemble padthai  or even the most americanized version of it i have had in my life  if they call it rice noodle chowmen  it would be much more forgivable because thats what it really is but when you are lured to go there by their claim of thai food  you will feel like these are a big marketing illusion that makes you want to kick yourself afterward  i order two curries by different names i have cooked with thai food with the real thai ingredients enough to tell that these are made from exactly the same curry base with slightly different amount of water added and different vegetablesunnecessary additives and this is not the way thai curries work i took one bite of each and could not force myself to enjoy it even though i had paid for it  their thai basil stirfry is the worst news of all im not sure if they even bother using the dried real thai basil to me  it tasted like dried italian basil and they can only fool those people who have not had the real deal of thai food   so for a 78 bucks worth of noodle  go to some chinese restaurant would be my better recommendation you should either 1 get much more food or 2 cheaper food 3 both,negative
sorry le dog  i made a mistake by thinking you were a hot dog place i mean  your name is le dog i realize after reading all these reviews i should have ordered soup so for now  i will have to give you 1 star  and when i return and have the soups  i will reconsider   anyway  about the hot dogs  the buns were straight from a bag  low quality  not toasted at all the meat itself was like straight from a supermarket as well very poor quality people who have been to berkeley know the high quality hotdog place called top dog  i was hoping for something like this  but was very dissapointed i think if the hot dogs themselves are so poor  they should just rename the shop le soup and stop serving hotdogs altogether i am very curious to go back and have some soup though  in summary  my bad for not ordering soup  but le dogs bad for selling hotdogs and naming themself le dog,negative
ive had a few sandwiches here  subs were ok hard to mess up but the falafels are way worse than the ones at the food trucks  interesting that every positive review about this place has been filtered by yelps secret algorithm  presumably because they look an awful lot like they were written by the owners trying to salvage their rating  that just about sums up kendall market,negative
been here several times for drinks worth going for the monday night 10 cent wings and some beers avoid all other times  ate an actual meal here yesterday for lunch and food was below average boyfriend ordered the pastrami  and i ordered the crab cake sandwich that came with a side of cole slaw and french fries asked if i could substitute the cole slaw for another vegetable side  but was rejected thats fine   things got weird after i got my food crab cake sandwich had half a dollop of the aioli sauce that was mentioned in the menu it was tasteless i asked for some sauce  aioli  tarter  really just anything to make it taste like something waiter rolled her eyes and said the management was stingy and told me nounless i want to pay an extra 50 cents for it yes  50 cents isnt much  but after showing her the lack of sauce in my sandwich  she wouldnt budge whatever  super annoying then 10 minutes after we were eating  the waiter comes over  mumbles something incoherent  and takes away my halfeaten coleslaw wtf i was so confused  annoyed and just hungry    summary  1 management is stingy as witnessed and quoted by the server 2 paying 30 for two mediocrebelow average sandwiches and cold fries sucks 3 hold on to your food or it might get randomly taken away by the server,negative
very disappointing i just got back from lunch at za and the pizzas are pretty bad to say the least the dough bears no resemblance to any kind of vaguely decent pizza dough it has no chewiness  bad flavor  tastes like someone made a sad bread dough and stretched it thin in a somewhat deep pizza dish the sauce and cheese tasted straight out of your grocers freezer seriously  there are much better frozen pizzas than this   the avocado salad on the other hand was tasty avocado was ripe and the dressing was nice  not sure cheese was necessary since cold shredded cheese like that doesnt tend to add a ton in the way of flavor but overall good   on to dessert unbelievably bad my friend tried their goat cheese chocolate cheesecake she is not sure she likes goat cheese so she asked the server how strong it was he said it tasted like regular cheesecake and then quickly added a i love it  its my favorite it was almost indescribably badtasted like pure goat cheese so strong it was probably off mixed with some bittersweet cocoa powder if there was sugar there we didnt really notice it she returned it the server was very nice and apologized but we still had to pay for it and  after returning the cake we notice a couple more being returned to the kitchen so it wasnt just us   i definitely plan not to eat here any time soon but one thing i would consider is coming for a beer after work the bar looks nice and  im hoping  they cant really screw up beer,negative
typical harvard sqall style  no substance  i know its a bar at night  but they have a big we serve breakfast sign out front  worst breakfast  ever burnt shirred eggs with burnt potatoes on the side i mean completely burnt  not over browned  but charcoal burnt  honestly  how can you fuck up breakfast just fry some eggs  add bacon and butter some toast and im happy  harvard sq restaurants have reached a new low now im nostalgic for the old green house cafe  which wasnt even that good,negative
overpriced and thoughtless  bland food  i could not even finish my lobster risotto  which is pathetic  if you are cooking with lobster meat which only needs butter to taste good there really is  no excuse to mess up   like someone else here i would have loved to send it back but i genuinely doubted they would come back with anything better    one gets the feeling the only way this place has customers is because of the location  put this restaurant anywhere other than harvard square and it would be empty  for the same price you are much much better off at any of the high end restaurants in central sq,negative
ugh this food is gross but im biased since im from los angeles  where food is good injera was white  food did not have a touch of spice or flavor  and its way too overpriced for what it is this place totally waters down ethiopian cuisine to make it suitable for ann arborites definitely do not go here if youre used to real ethiopian,negative
i love the waffle house  really i do i take my 4 year old out for a waffle and he loves it i had never taken him to this particular wh  and boy was it special heres the list of firsts 1 waitress takes a phone call in the middle of taking our order tells me to hold up 2 when my boy asks about the tattoo on her arm  she grants him the knowledge that once you get a tattoo  youre gonna wind up back in jail once the police know to look for that tattoo youre gonna wind up back in jail 3 the waitress takes another phone call and walks out the back door to take it proceeds to lock herself out  and a customer must let her in  overall  not one of my best wh experiences,negative
im not sure why people go here for cupcakes  karas cupcakes in town  country is soooo much better  first of all  they dont tell you this  but they charge you tax when you say you are eating here  versus if you take it to go  i tried their most popular cupcake red velvet  it was acceptable  chocolate cake was moist and good flavor  but frosting is way too sweet  i also tried the milk chocolate  and this was unbelievably bad  we only took two bites and had to throw it away  it tastes like something you get from safeway  frosting is sweet and synthetic  and the cake was one of the most disgusting chocolate cake i had  tastes like synthetic chocolate dry muffin  maybe it was a bad batch or something  their cupcakes look cute but not tasty  i will never waste another 350 on any of their cupcakes  highly recommend karas cupcakes if you havent try,negative
i always meant to eat here  and see what kind of restaurant filled shalimars old space but i wont  now as i was strolling down the ave a few weeks ago one of the employees saw me and made nasty kissy faces through the window  and then he ran out to the back door to stand in the doorway  leer  and wolf whistle hella nasty  discourteous  and unprofessional  i will not be giving gran sabor my money i miss pepes really badly  but ill make do with chipotle the ave can be skeezy enough without businesses upping the street harassment if i could give them negative stars i would theres too many decent mexican restaurants to put up with outofline behavior like that i just feel sorry for the owners,negative
it was a nasty summer day in boston  middle of july  90 degrees  mercilessly bright  air so thick you could cut it with a knife perfect day to stay inside  eat ice chips  watch reruns  and enjoy the ac where was i smack in the middle of the heat  on the streets  slowly dying as my friends dragged me to hsin hsin for lunch the only thing keeping me going was the thought of cool  recycled air at the end of the journey  but there was no cool air to be had the ac was turned off why whyyyy meanwhile  the sweaty bodies of the dozens of loud  overexcited undergrad diners filled the stale  muggy air with the smell of hormonepacked bo seconds after sitting down at our booth  i could feel moisture gathering under my legs it was so damn hot hoping to avoid leaving an embarrassing wet mark on the back of my dress  i stuck a few cheapass  thinass napkins under my thighs  only to have them almost immediately dissolve and stick in unattractive clumps to the backs of my legs was this hell  at least the food was worth the trip  right nope my sweet  sour pork was dry and tasted like the meat had gone bad the lobster soup was thick  and brown  and gloopy the fried rice was decent  but can anyone really screw up fried rice the best things on my plate were the crab rangoons  but in that kind of heat  fried foods sit in the stomach about as well as balls of lead yummy  whats utterly baffling to me is how the bf and his buddies can continue to consistently eat here late night study breaks hsin hsins brunch line at pour house too long hsin hsins craving shitty really shitty food hsin hsins the only explanation for this is the late delivery hours and relatively cheap prices  huge portions still  who would want giant servings of rancid sludge  right  ive known all along that the bf has poor taste in chinese food  but this has got to stop its time for desperate measures  every time he orders from hsin hsins  im going to make him get a manzilian im pretty sure thats a fair trade off,negative
this restaurant is one of the reasons that i dislike chains  burgers are greasy not juicy greasy  decent salad bar  not dazzling decent  will not be back,negative
oh dear me i drafted a review on my phone  then i read other user reviews on here  ann arbor  wtf how can people actually think this place is worth the   it doesnt have atmosphere  authenticity or good food  i know  i lived in japan for 7 months it isnt good sushi by japanese standards  neveryoumind completely lacking the amazing creativity american restaurant owners put into it and its more expensive than eating at the fing lark      here is my suggestion  before anyone else decide something must be authentic due to its run down interior  shitty food  absurd menu  terrible prices and rate it as a 4 star restaurant dont just dont do it  then i wont have to go there and see if you are right and piss myself off      here is my initial review  something has changed here the menu is smaller and more expensive since i was here last and the food isnt as good  in fact its mediocre and the sushi menu isnt creative at all   i ordered a softshell crab app  from a picture and it came out as a single crab  fried thats it thats all there was perfect well it was also 20   there are other 20 appetizers here as well 6 fried oysters 20 among them   total order 1 gyoza 1 softshell crab 1 salmon sashimi rice  paper  salmon no sesame no vegetable 1 spicy california roll globs of spicy mayo on a shit california roll 2 tempura shrimp roll shrimp tempura  cucumber  rice  paper  bill total 75 with tip  i dont mind dropping 75 on dinner for two at a nice place  but this isnt anywhere near that kind of place,negative
if you enjoy a little spice in your life  dont go here  all of the food tasted so bland comparable to what i would imagine pureed toilet papers flavor to be that i had to stop eating my meal even though my stomach was still growling  there was absolutely no taste in anything on my plate  and i felt as though i was eating merely for survival purposes surely wasnt eating for enjoyment  about ten minutes after my order came  the waiter brought my check and asked if i wanted a boxwhile i was still trying to consume the tasteless mess banditos called a burrito  never have i been rushed out of a restaurant like this  the most shocking part was that nobody else came in to the restaurant the entire time we were there  and the table that was already eating when we arrived was rushed out shortly after we showed up by the wait staff  weird  strange  blah  dont waste your money,negative
oh yam yamits not you  its meno  it really is you i care for you but i think were headed in different directions in our lives im striving for excellence and well  youre not in summation i used to love yamatos because the sushi was fresh  the prices were great but when i went back this weekend  im sorry to say  but my feelings have changed first of all  our waiter sucked dirty sweaty rancid balls he was slow to take our orders and when it came out  it was the wrong items which happens  yes but not when my friend orders two orders of hamachi nigiri and he corrects the pronounciation to nagori nagori like what are you doing in a sushi restaurant  bro there were four people in our party he took one persons order of teriyaki chicken then leaves to go put that order in  then comes back 10 minutes later to take the rest of the orders the order of teriyaki chicken came out 20 mins before the rest of the partys food comes out so we all sat there waiting until everyones food came out and so my friend ended up eating cold chicken gross then i asked for a side of ponzu and extra ginger because i cant even start my meal without it i refuse that took me asking a busboy and another 15 minutes later for it to come out i mean seriously my tempura was cold my pink roll was warm needless to say  i wont be coming back there are too many mediocre sushi places in la with good service  why would i go to one with bad  scratch that  horrible service,negative
sucks ate here for the first time despite colleagues warnings they were right have a severe headache from the msg food was salty  rice was old and the temp of the food suggested that it had just been sitting there horrible,negative
never again i am so sad to be writing this review as i had a pleasant experience here just days ago  but today has just put gypsy cafe on my never visit again list  my coworkers and i come to gypsy cafe today for a quick lunch and by all appearances it should have been as there were only 3 tables occupied inside when we arrived   we were met by our very rude waitress melody wish her attitude matched her name who seated us promptly with almost an air of disgust  we order our food  three sandwiches and a cheese pizza nothing complicated and waited approximately 3045 minutes for our food to arrive and saw others who had arrived after us be served promptly   when our food finally did arrive  there was no apology for the wait only our plates dropped down in front of us not once were we checked on for refills or anything the check comes and theres a dandy guest comment card we filled it out and proceeded to try to give it to the owner who was occupied on the phone but could have glanced my way to take the card but instead chose to ignore the customer that was a few feet away   wish i could give this place zero stars the food is good but not good enough to deal with that kind of service,negative
horrible came here 30 minutes ago for a lunch birthday celebration with my work crew we were seated in a beautiful private room we had great expectations as we had heard great things about the restaurant i ordered the flat iron steak sandwich  which was open faced  small and drenched in some thick  texturally questionable horseradish sauce it was just okay  nothing special for 15 my coworker ordered the roasted tuna sandwich  when her food arrived it was a tuna salad sandwich she spoke with the waiter and explained that the description of the dish was drastically different from what was delivered she returned her dish and asked for the ahi tuna salad when her food arrived  there was a big  long  nasty hair smack dab in the middle of her salad it was visible to others sitting next to her gross the waiter just took the plate away and 15 minutes later returned with another salad the manager didnt present at all during this time frame of disgust  shock and horror when the waiter brought the 2nd attempt  he then asked if my coworker would like to speak to the manager   when the manager arrived  he says we only have males in the kitchen  so i dont understand how this could happen what does that have to do with the fact that it did happen he kept saying this over and over as to imply that my coworker put the hair in her own salad he finally apologized and seemed irritated and asked what he could do for her they ended up not charging her for her meal   never again  overpriced  rude staff and you may get an extra surprise in your meal,negative
worst service of my life never left a place so upset yelpers  beware  let me start off with saying that i have been here twice first time the service was slow  but we got our drinks mardarin cosmos which were decent and left moderately satisfied   the next time my friends came up and wanted to catch up  grab a bite  and have a couple of drinks after a long day of work i decided to give this place a shot thinking maybe wed get better service this time around and i wanted to bring my friends here because i really liked the ambiance of this place chic  dimly lit  good beats  more of an upscale lounge compared to the dives in westwood   my friends and i arrived around 1130ish and waited for 35 minutes for the hostess to approach us only for her to tell us to sit wherever for a wednesday night  there were was decent crowd but not super crowded  we were seated and given a menu happy hour portion of the menu is kind of confusing they only have a small hh drink selection at the bottom of the menu anyway  the four of us were planning on each ordering a few drinks and a bunch of appetizers and a pizza    we waited for a server to come by for 30 minutes not a single person stopped by our table since we received our menu the hostess was running around waiting on others  but didnt even look at us we saw other waiters chatting it up at the bar and assisting a few particular tables but no one came by our table we called the hostess over and asked if she could have some take our order she said shell let our waiter know we waited another 10 minutes no one came by my friends and i were so upset we got up and left  and before we even got out the door a waitress came up to the table and cleaned up the table and cleared the menus    are you kidding me she couldnt come over to take our order but she could come as soon as we got up to clear the table what kind of service is that   after we left the place  my friends were livid and they wanted to call the place and complain about how ridiculous service was my boyfriend called and asked for the manager that night he complained about our service and explain how we got up and left because no one helped us for 40 minutes instead of sincerely apologizing this female manager had the nerve to make excuses saying that there was confusion about who was going to be our waiter really confusion for 40 minutes she also said she saw us leave and i think she was the one who came to clear up the table the phone call ended with insincere apology and nothing fixed  the management and servers here really need to pick it up if they want to survive in westwood where business get shut down left and right    i really wish i had better service because i wanted to like this place and have it be a regular hangout spot for my friends and i what a shame what a shame,negative
service slow  atmosphere amis has a dark  chic decor in the inside  but thats really the only nice thing about the place the sushi is not fresh  food the main criterion for a sushi joint for me is the quality of the fish and the freshness of it  i had a spicy tuna roll here once and they didnt cleancut the fish correctly and so it had a real fishy taste my friends and i have gone a couple of times and not once have i been impressed with any of their rolls or sushi food is below average one time we ordered a bunch of spicy rolls with jalapenos and peppers we got food poisoning the next day such a bad experience theres another mediocre sushi joints in westwood that you can go to instead of amis,negative
note my friend insisted on eating here since it was her birthday i had already decided to not come here by choice ever again and yet  heres my update  service this past time was terrible we waited during a nonpeak time for 1520 minutes to get our drinks in  another 510 after that to order food drinks took about 2025 minutes to come out  and food was about 40 minutes wtf seriously how hard is it to blend a fricken margarita take some of your shitty cuervo  toss in the lime  throw on too much salt  add not enough cointreau and too much ice hit blend  this time im serious im not coming here again even if it is someones birthday sorry  but ill meet up with you for the afterparty instead if i update this again  i give you all permission to slap me,negative
what is wrong with your sandwhich makers could they be any slower everytime i stand in line to order a sandwhich  i end up regretting it if you want the sandwhich toasted  they stand there watching it warm up until it is ready instead of starting the next customers order so inefficient,negative
totally uninspired food  once i ordered the pasta entree and it was halffrozen   i had to heat it up in the microwave  the tomato sauce was the same kind of sauce that comes with fried mozzarella sticks   the bread tastes like greasy donutsand not in a good way another time i got the vegetarian soup option and horror there was meat in it  maybe they gave me the wrong soup  i didnt go back to find out   the salads seem okay  and someone related to this restaurant makes a decent cupcake that can be found in the refrigerated case  but other than that i dont think i would ever touch anything from there ever again   its depressing to go to a restaurant that has no inspiration or passion  a place that is serving formulaic food just to make money  you can tell from the employees  too nice as they are that they have no connection to this food  i cant imagine how or why it came to be that there are so many of these places in the boston area you might as well buy a shrinkwrapped sandwich from a gas station market instead of eating here   at least you know what youre getting,negative
baaaaa d  i guess im just over the crowded college scene  no room to move away from the bar once you get your drinks  no easy way to go pee drunk dudes looking you up and down like they want to fight i havent ever been here before  so i dont know what its like on a slow night  but i know i was getting frustrated being there   it definitely is for a certain type of person just not me,negative
my friends and i stopped here before class one morning a couple of months ago  i love me a good breakfast  whether its just some nice fluffy scrambled eggs  or a whopping chicken fried steak covered in gravy with such high acclaim voted best breakfast in slo and slo county numerous times  or so it says i thought it was going to be a great breakfast joint i must say  i was highly disappointed with the breakfast i received  i ordered the corned beef hash  and it was just awful  canned canned corned beef hash that was hardly even heated  it flat out sucked  who serves canned food at a diner why even serve it if youre gonna serve canned stuff  on top of that  the toast was mediocre  nothing i couldnt get from a grocery store and a toaster  and my scrambled eggs were flat and somewhat rubbery  something i could achieve when i was making eggs as a 10 year old  the atmosphere is dinerlike  nothing too special going on  relatively clean  but its pretty old  to sum it up  i essentially hate this place  though i must say i hate it more because of how popular it is to everyone else  i wont ever come back here for breakfast  not worth my time  money  or abuse to my mouth and stomach  ps i had a tritip sandwich from their booth at the farmers market sucked meat was bland  bread wasnt good  barbecue sauce tasted like it came straight out of a bottle of kraft barbecue sauce and personally  i think thats one of the worst bottled barbecue sauces  disgusting  do yourself a favor and get a tritip from the firestone grill,negative
horrible service when trying to buy a sandwich obviously this review is tainted by the fact that one person gave me a headache   grilled foccciasp sandwich  sorry machine is broken  is a cold 3 day old sandwich ok black forest ham  sorry no more black forest extra meat  sorry we have to charge you for the meat separetly before we put it in your sandwich  i think this lady was just being lazylast time i think about having lunch here,negative
the worseeeewent with my son  wich was turning 2 and the ownermanager came and gave me this shitty excuse of why i couldnt get fried rice he said i had to be sitting on the habachi grill  versus sitting outside gtfoh serious then he continued to to tell me  that he would not even serve his son rice  if he wanted it and wasnt sitting on the hibachi grill failofyear shut it dowwwwwn,negative
what a waste of money  unless maybe youre wasted  i had high hopes considering the novelty of rooftop dining in pittsburgh for the price point  the food and service should be a lot better  the hostesses were rude  refused to sit us in the booth and then immediately sat a couple in a booth right after us  server was sweet  but painfully slow and never refilled our water the cocktails were no where what was described about 1012 bucks a pop and zero buzz  a couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours  and when we did it was very disappointing  the guacamole was just mashed avocados  no seasoning whatsoever  the rice was clearly a mix like zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained  really gross  the shrimp in the tacos were well cooked  but it was all downhill from there  no flavor  overcooked veggies and to top off two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco  having no flavor is the worst crime against mexican food being slow and rude  the worst crime against service  really terrible place,negative
all aspects of this place are against pizza common sense they dont serve slices fresh from the oven  they purposely cool them down and reheat when ordered  their excuse is that the pizza is too flimsy id rather have flimsy fresh pizza than reheated leftovers anyday  their crust is as with all newengland type of crust flimsy flaky with no fight or stretch  perfect for denture wearers    so why would anyone want leftover pizza with a saltinecracker crust  goto picco or posto for real fresh pizza  though denture wearers beware,negative
as a born and bred bostonian  i grew up loving dunkin donuts  or dunkies as we used to say growing up  my favorite beverage was the iced coffee  which i still like  but  on a recent visit to dunkins after a hiatus  i noticed they still use styrofoam cups for their medium and large sized beverages  in this day and age  thats just unacceptable  one might argue that the use of styrofoam cups allows dunkins to keep prices low  but if you actually compare prices for their espresso drinks lattes  cappucinos  etc they are fairly comparable to prices at other coffee shops such as peetswhich dont use styrofoam and  in fact  have better espresso beverages  my other complaint is that there is little consistency from one dunkins to the nexti used to go to one near my work where they make the iced coffees exactly right  but at the other ones the iced coffee would be too dark or have too much sugar   there was a time when coffee shops werent all the rage and dunkins had little competition  but they have not been able to keep up sorry dunkies  but unless there are no other coffee shops within a 10 mile radius  i wont be back,negative
this place is horrific  terrible service and thirdrate food  the only thing that makes the atmosphere fun is the liveliness of the college students there  my waitress was rude and in a bad mood  maybe she is sick of serving brainiac mit students  or maybe she wasnt help as a baby  either way  im not responsible  its a miracle of i ever come back,negative
this place is on my way to work i love to change it up and go to various places for coffee on my way into work  so i thought id stop by sebastians for a quick cappuccino one morning big mistake the cappuccino tasted like cleaning chemicals and was the same price as a lot of other joints in the area starbucks  abp  cosi  etc also  the chef there was looming over the cashiers and breakfastmaking staff trying to get them to move faster and it was a very awkward situation to watch him lord over them i will never get coffee or any other time of edible item here again,negative
it should be called vegan galaxy im vegetarian and was so wanting this place to be goodbut it just was terrible the kendall burger sounded good but the onion rings were tasteless  the patty fell apart and the dressed arugula and shredded cabbage were sorry sides an order of fries cant be wrong  can it oh no  tasteless strikes again they seem to think that you can throw a dusting of an herb on top of anything and call it done it left me wondering if they had sucked the flavor out of the fries and maybe injected it into some other dish all desserts we ordered were inedible i will never ever go here again ,negative
this review is for the restaurant some friends and i were meeting on a saturday night near the holidays and sat a big table weve done this in the past and it was fine  we all ordered drinks and appetizers to share  the waitress was nice when she took our order  the place wasnt even packed and we got our drinks and food pretty quickly    about 5 minutes after we got our food  the waitress comes over to tell us that we need to move from our table because we sat a table that was reserved for a private party there was nothing on the table to indicate this the table behind us and the tables against the wall had reserved signs on them but not our table we were pretty much in shock at being told that we had to move if you want us to move  then you should relocate us or help us find somewhere to move to dont just expect me to move because you screwed up and forgot to put a reserved sign on the table where i have been sitting for nearly an hour now i dont expect four star service at a place like this but if youre going to screw up  dont expect me to fix your mistake for you that is why you get paid we asked for a manager we never got to speak to one a little bit of attention to paying customers would be nice from the management we never had anyone come to our table and take our check we all had to walk to the bar to pay our bill  the complete lack of professionalism here is astounding  it was a nice experience until they realized they needed another table for their reservation but this experience was a deal breaker for me slo brews management and staff need to get it together because my friends and i will never return because of how rudely we were treated,negative
this used to be a great restaurant  even for a chain then  they changed the menu and servers here and its just become a total crapshoot i hadnt been there in a long time and decided to meet a friend for lunch they had just horrible  nonexistent service not once did they refill any of our drinks  even after we asked for refills  it took forever to get our food my friends pizza was good and i enjoyed my spaghetti i would have given them 2 stars and another shot but for what i saw on my bank statement when i got home i paid with our credit card and my friend left a cash tip on the table when i looked at my credit card bill  someone at the restaurant put a tip on my card i called my credit card company to dispute the additional tip on my card and called the restaurant they apologized and said they would take it off i told them that i had already done that with my credit card company and was also going to inform the slo police department regarding the fraudulent charge to my credit card this just reinforces why everyone should check their bank statements against the receipt they are given needless to say  i will not be returning to this establishment,negative
my family and i went there because of the excellent times we have had there in the past we have never been there for dinner before but with a choir performance to see we gave it a shot we decided to go with the fish and chips as well as chicken and chips along with  of course  clam chowder the chowder was good but was quite salty the fish and chicken were terrible i guess you dont expect much for 8 but i do expect for my food not to be swimming in grease also  we were excited about the curly fries over half of them were either under or overcooked the night shift needs quite a bit of help we were just not happy with our crappy experience,negative
abysmal this pizza is consistently advertised as best in rhode island on wbru i would recommend that victorias pizzeria stop spending money on commercials and start spending money on producing a quality product  my friends and i had pizza there this evening  we drove from greenville  ri to get it because of its muchtalkedabout qualities the barbeque pizza was recommended  we added bacon to it  tasteless  doughy and cooked excessively on top and not at all on the bottom is what seems to be the common sentiment from the other reviewers here  i share that with them the bacon  appeared to be bacon bits  the crust was unseasoned and clearly preproduced the similarity to a lowtier frozen pizza at your local grocer is where this pie ranked  the establishment is  ostensibly  a convenient store cigarettes and lottery tickets appear to be on sale here  as well as a variety of vending gondolas for grabandgo type foods the excessive clutter  lack of focus on customer service due to the counterpersons unbelievable inability to make eye contact while speaking to me and the poor quality product earn this pizzeria a solid one  this isnt a pizzeria  its a sacrilege stay clear,negative
i went here after reading the great reviews ive never done hookah or weed or cigarretes before and my date and i  thought it would be fun we had a fun time and around 1 am the place started to empty out we were sitting next to the drafty stairs and moved our seats   like any bar we thought that would be ok when our waitress came over we asked to make sure that it was ok and before she could answer a hostess came over literally screaming at me and told me how where i was sitting was for bigger parties ie more money and i said we were cold where we were  she then ripped the drum i was holding and playing with from me and humiliated me in front of my date while she continued to yell at me  my waitress was very sympathetic and understood when i asked for the check i confronted the hostess after and told her she didnt have to treat us like dirt and that she ruined a great night i was having she was remorselessso we decided to go to the owner to complain  her only concern was that we moved without asking again place was 60 empty by then and it was our first time does that excuse the behavior apparently  the owner made no amends  didnt apologize at all  didnt offer anything  didnt seem to care about anything other than the fact that we moved i explained again that it was our first time and we arent trouble makers she didnt care  i am under no illusions that if you like hookah and like going out to drink that you will avoid this place because of my review  but i think the true character of this place should be revealed no one should be harassed like this and management should not allow or condone it   again started out as a great fun night and  i left there literally in tears management saw me in tears and couldnt have cared less,negative
one word   brutal,negative
i went to this place yesterday after reading some good reviews  this place is not up to par with my indian food standards and im an indian food connoisseur  i will not go back to this placeever because of the following  1 dirty plates and cups  2 water tasted like warm tap water  dirty i should have brought my nalgene 3 the tea was bittersweet  even added sugar to try to alleviate the bitterness 4 naan bread seemed stale and not luxuriously fluffy  like it should be 5 dishes were spicy which is actually good because thats how indian food should be  but spice does not equal taste  the spiciness was so overwhelming that the taste was somewhere lost in transition 6 the rice came with little chunks  poor basmati rice etiquette 7 the chicken in the chicken  cauliflower dish i forgot the name  but besides the point was extremely dry  disgusting it was like the chicken was cooked separately and thrown in as an afterthought  i will never go back to this indian food place again  i was so disappointed  naan  curry is way better than this joint and a little cheaper  too  and they have clean dishescups,negative
the hot dogs here are alright ive had the hotlink  the chicken apple  and the lemon chicken they are all super small  and very pricey all dogs are 3 bucks honestly  the hot dogs seem like things you can find at a local safeway or trader joes  nothing special about them what so ever   the place is really crowded and trashy  and the guy that works there is a complete dbag my friend was with me and he didnt know what to order  so he was looking over the selection  and my friend literally only spent like 30 seconds looking at the menu  when the guy working there  told him to order a dog or leavewhat a jackass,negative
i couldve understood the appeal of cpk six or seven years ago  when new american cuisine and fusion were still in vogue in the culinary world  but now the popularity of this franchise is flabbergasting  theyll throw anything and everything on a pizza  and hope it works its kind of like writing a script on index cards  throwing them in the air  and determining the structure based on which ones you pick up first  i dont want carne asada on a pizza i dont want guacamole and sour cream on a pizza i dont want peanuts on a pizza i dont want potatoes on a pizza i dont want mangos on pizza  whats worse is that cpk wants you to think that  to quote samuel l jackson in pulp fiction  youre getting the gourmet shit no  youre not getting a burrito on a pizza is just a bad idea  and it should be stopped  they dont offer much else  paninis  ceasar salad  thai chicken peanut pasta  etc  etc  etc,negative
everything about this bar sucks 45646477474378923342131 times 8 876 046  squared,negative
when youre from san diego this is no where close to mexican food,negative
the fried fish was aweful the fish had no spices for taste at all  the oil in which it was tried was stale the fish had this stale oil taste  the curry in the meal had weird spice taste as well wonder if its the stale oil again their chicken kabobs might be better since that seemed the standard one everyone was ordering in general  my first experience was not very satisfactory the other indianpakistani restaurants sitar  new delhi around the corner have better tasting meals for cheaper price,negative
i have no other alternative than to shop here as i dont own a car and any other grocery store is too far away from my place than this one but i have started hating it more and more  they regularly carry very old dairy products milk  yogurt  cheeses and produce i have found rotting cheeses and other produce full of fungus growing over it in the deli section  they remove good products from their selection completely like i used to buy one particular bakerys chocolate cake cant remember the name which was made from very healthy wholesome ingredients  but they discontinued it and now replaced with that are unhealthy fatty cakes  i wish i was staying in some other area and didnt have to shop my groceries here i hate this store to the core,negative
food poisoning woke up at 2am throwing my guts up   i really think it was the cheese it had a very strong sake base and the alcohol was very strong and overwhelming   over priced  small portions if i were ever to come back which i highly doubt  i would only come for the dessert which was good but then again  its really hard for something dripping in chocolate not to be good,negative
it was moderatly busy a party of five  seated immediatly and ordered cocktails and water for the table waitress left and came back 10 minutes later to take food orders 5 minutes later receive cocktails  10 minutes later we remind her about the water for the table  receive it 5 minutes later about 10 minutes later one of our party orders an extra app and not more than 60 second later the fried calamari he ordered came out  so wheres our food 15 minutes later is where  the dumplings were greasy and had almost no filling  everything else was average  so heres the kicker they gave absolute crap service and then tacked on 18 tip  thankfully we were able to give 5 with the hopes that they tipped out to the bartender for the drinks,negative
this review is solely based on the service here   i dont remember the name of the waitress who served us  but i didnt come back to find out    my sister  her boyfriend  and i came here for breakfast  the service was fine we knew that we didnt leave enough tip when she took the check  but she sounded hurried so we let her take the check and told her that we didnt need change  no more than a minute later  while we were still sitting and sorting out her tip mind you money was on the table and our wallets were still open  she came up to us and demanded to know why we didnt tip her and told us that if the service was bad  we should have let her know  she was loud enough that people around us stopped eating and looked up at us  i know this because i sat facing them  we have never been so mortified and embarrassed    if she had just walked by and listened to our conversation or just looked at our actions  she would have known that we werent about to skip without leaving her a tip  at that time we threw down some money and just left as quickly as we could  but in hindsight we should have called over the manager and let the waitress have it  this was completely unacceptable service  if the service was bad  she could have waited to talked to us as we were leaving the restaurant in a more appropriate tone and volume  its been a while since this incident and im positive she no longer works there  but as a note to management  please make sure you train your staff on how to be discreet  its common sense  but you cant assume that people have it,negative
my friend and i were listening to music and painting  we were hungry but didnt want to go outside  i didnt know what i wanted so i left the decision up to him  he chose italian  he said he didnt know of anywhere in the area and didnt have any takeout menus and asked if i had any suggestions  i really dont eat italian food very often and i really dont know the area very well but i remembered a formerfriend favorablymentioning presidential pizza so i suggested it  and everything went downhill from there  it ended up bordering on the absolutely absurd  we looked it up on google to get the phone number  we were sent to a page of reviews  and it was preposterous how many of the reviews were glowing and hysterically phrased presidential pizza is the best pizza in the planet earth nyc has the best pizza in the planet presidential pizza is the best in nyc  and presidential pizza has the best pizza in the universe its always fresh and perfectly delicious its the best italian food i ever had i recommend penne vodka with grilled chicken the pizza is to die for  and presidential pizza is the best pizza you will ever taste just thinking about it makes my mouth watered there is something about the tomato sauce  the best in the world  and presidential pizza its by far the best pizza i ever had perfect crust  perfect cheese  perfect souse yum men is delicious  why not try it  right as julia roberts says in pretty woman big mistake huge  we got a caesar salad which was gross  the dressing was really salty and sweet  the croutons were stale and really salty  and the lettuce was slightly brown and we got a large steak pizza  the meat was tough and oily  the cheese was tough and oily  and the crust was cold and chewy and we got the fettuccine alfredo with grilled shrimp  which was extremely oily and salty  and it had congealed into a big lump  yuck  an absolutely horrible experience all around we ended up throwing out about 75 of the food rather than further torturing ourselves and one another  we really only had a couple bites each of each item and that was way more than enough,negative
overcooked  overbooked  overpriced,negative
finding good eats around columbia university can be a challenge  especially on broadway the options on amsterdam are better the broadway section of the neighborhood is full of places like vine  which look sleek  but offer nothing in terms of quality   vine suffers from the asian fusion disease that seems to plague manhattan nobu made asian fusion fashionable asian fusion establishments with their own version of the rock shrimp tempura in a creamy spicy sauce began to sprout all over manhattan the problem is that most of these restaurants are not run by experienced and inventive chefs capable of making wildly imaginative dishes that combine the flavors and textures of peru  japan  china and france instead  they make insipid versions of various asian dishes     the management at vine is chinese im sure they could whip up some decent chinese food but there are no chinese items on the menu the selection ranges from pad thai to sushi  passing through udon noodle soup and chicken teriyaki i had the udon noodle soup with a salad the soup was woefully lacking in flavor the salad was not fresh,negative
panda express is panda express better than other steamtable chinese chains  not good for much of anything else  you can get it all over the place why did it have to come to the stanford student center food court and push out the previous chinese place  which at least was different and not panda express all the bloody time  and had really good saltandpepper chicken wings  ive only eaten here a couple of times  but i have to report that one lunchtime recently was the only time ive ever had really bad service at a panda express  the server taking my order was just utterly clueless and had no idea what i wanted  either when i said it or pointed to it  and mostly stood there looking dim  i gave up and walked out  had a teriyaki bowl at the treehouse instead  much better  and not the exact same thing i can get in a million other places,negative
stopped in for a beer  sat on the patio and had an insipid porter and a bland ipa  the wafting stench from something that must have been dead and rotting on the river bank below didnt help  beer reminded me of what youd get at a brewpub run by ab or coorsmolson,negative
the name fits  its south troy  what do you expect worst burger outside of a prison  assuming they serve burgers in prison,negative
the food is disgusting this is the restaurant against which i judge every other awful restaurantthe brown standard id imagine the two positive reviews here are made by the owner and his friends i have no idea how this awful place stays in business,negative
flavorless garbage   not much else to say  maybe one thing else  youre better off eating a pbj sandwich,negative
when it comes to chinese food i am pretty easy to please but this place was horrible i could not get over how my food tasted reheated the rice also had old taste to it my friend ordered sushi and regretted it dearly as we both noticed the worker at the sushi with his finger knuckle deep in his nose and then with no gloves handle some of the sushi just plain eeeek all around,negative
gave it another shot theres no hope for this place,negative
their chicken taste like pork awful music along with the food,negative
we went here a few times as college students the long wait  small and stuffy dining area and rude service could be forgiven if the food was good  it was not unless you like burned and overgreasy pad thai  skip this dump for the better thai places on the ave,negative
i had vegi yakisoba the noodles were not throughly cooked  it all sticked together and hard to eat  i also had tofu vege stir fry thing the tofu was covered with batter but not cooked throughly as well it was sticky and moosy i am not going there anymore,negative
the staffs are rude  food its not that bad inexpensive and okay taste the dough is extremely dry so i needed alot of water that goes along they dont have any hot sauce i havent asked for it but what they usually display is pepper sprinkle  customer care   thank you for playing music extremely loud every night although i have informed them three times regarding loud music after 10pm on weekdays and 11pm on weekends  they dont seem to control the volume of the music once i saw them playing music at 1240 am while they were closing and cleaning the place not able to communicate with customer  unprofessional it does not matter whether i talked to the cashier or cook or district manager they ignore customers opinion and go on with its company policy it really wowed me  lets see what they will say when the civic law involves in,negative
this is my first cliche i give this place zero stars review hmmm the wife wanted a bubble tea while hanging out on the ave the place was dead  maybe 23 customers sitting there  place was a mess tables w chairs out and napkins n trash everywhere this stuff doesnt bother me what does is my wife waiting in front of the cashier for literally 1 12 mins  not a watching lord of the rings type 90 seconds  but a george constanza waiting for his conditioner to set in his hair 90 seconds a very long time to completely ignore a customer who is right in front of you the young little lady was counting change and instead of putting customers first and taking her order or even acknowledging her with any actual words while she was there  is simply rude  unacceptable but we did get a great big death glare as if we were bothering her as she went back to counting her change there was another lady working there chatting w a guy who either also works there or is the bf  hard to tell either way none of them were doing any work except for pissing off potential paying customers good for you  im sure you dont care but im sure the owner would oh well  clap clap clap good job,negative
several years ago  madam mams might have served delicious thai food for lower prices today  this is no longer true their prices are pretty high for a small dish i ordered a tomka soup there was too much coconut milk in the dish and in a very small bowl usually a sandwich from wendys will fill me up  this failed to make a dent in my hunger   not only that  they charge 3 for a bowl of rice i came back with friends several times again and tried both their pad thai and their pad see ew pad thai was slimy  and gross but their pad see ew was decent flat noodles  with chinese broccoli their thai tea is decent   i love thai food  and  i grew up eating after having traveled to thailand this summer  and despite me trying madam mams multiple times  i can assure you this is not real thai food the majority of the menu is a bland and poor imitation of thai food  and it is overpriced to boot,negative
sunhing bills itself as an authentic chineseviet restaurant    the chinese dishes are mediocre  the duck is dry  the sauce is lacking their viet food fare a little bit better the owners are vietchinese and im just disappointed for that amount  i expected better quality and more food    their food was just dry and not good   id go to any other restaurant,negative
so my brother and i flew all the way to maryland to watch our youngest brother compete in a martial arts competition  armed with our parents credit card  we promised to take him out to dinner anywhere he wanted  some fivestar restaurant in washington  dc  maybe  or baltimore  instead  he picked a restaurant a few blocks from our lovely ramada limited hotel see other review    first  they had about 4 different menus  one person in our group joked that it seemed like theyd taken menus from other restaurants and simply said to themselves yea  we can probably make that  also  when we asked at the end whether they had dessert  their answer was no  crazy talk  the food itself was average cheap chinese food  we didnt try any sushi  though they also offered that never a good sign    the most entertaining part was the rude old chinese waitresses  who made fun of our attempts to order  then ignored us  while making multiple visits to the table right next to us  for the rest of the evening  when we finally got their attention to order more tea  it turned out a bit frothy  the only time our waitress came without someone getting up out of their seat and grabbing her was after wed left payment on the table and started to leave  then she was on top of me in a flash  just to make sure wed paid  it actually was a little funny  but we only laughed to keep from crying,negative
for a place that has boba right in the name  the boba here was not very good i had the tapioca milk tea  and again  boba is in the name of the place  so why not call it that on the menu the tea itself was very sweet  which i happen to like but may not be for everyone the problem was that the boba was way too mushy  especially on the outside  and not the proper firm chewy texture throughout also  the boba was not sweet enough my friend had a strawberry kiwi smoothie and it was very watery instead of icy not worth another visit,negative
eww i hate islands the burger i ordered was not good the food was way too salty for me would not go back go somewhere else if you want a burger,negative
i did not like this place at all friend and i came here late night after notsoheavy drinking and each had the chicken shawarma wrap big mistake  the chicken was dry  the sauce was flavorless and runny  and it made me bloated and feeling like crap until the next afternoon so much so that chicken shawarma was a bad choice became an inside joke  ive had good shawarma before  and this place does not make it but what can you expect from a place that spells it falafal instead of an falafel on its storefront sign,negative
first  let me start by saying i am disappointed by their nonexistent organic produce selection if you are looking for organic produce  moms down the road is your best bet secondly  their prices are higher than their competitors   now to top it off  their customer service center is horrid they are extremely rude and offer no help to the customer i went in one afternoon to break a 5 bill for quarters since my apartment complexes laundry room only runs on quarters i asked the lady at the service center to break my bill and she just stood their  distant  arms crossed and told me in a rude and nasty way no we do not do that here go stand in line they might have change then her classy self sarcasm shouts to the guy working in the express line to give me quarters i told her i am not going anywhere then she changes the policy and tells me she can only give me change if i break a 10 bill i was very angry at her attitude and lack of genuine customer service skills so i left i called the manager immediately and he apologized and was very polite i later returned and talked to a female  the manager of the customer service center and she was able to break the 5 bill for quarters no problem   fast forward a month later i encountered the same problem with a difference customer service lady i told her i was not leaving without the change i requested so i had her page the customer service manager and the manager must have alzheimers because she said she denied ever talking to me and giving me change   rude and lazy customer service employees run the other way run to any other grocery store they seem to hire people with very little education  elementary at the highest,negative
i would not recommend this place purely based off of the interior  when we first sat down  we saw a cockroach crawling on the wall right by our table  this was definitely unappetizing  but we were willing to forget about it  the selection of food was great and we were craving all sorts of things  we were there for brunch  though  so we both ordered omelets  they were good  but it took a loooooong time to get our food    we were actually fed before another table that got there first  though  it was just one guy cooking and one guy serving when we went  you feel a little sympathetic to them  but still    not to mention that the whole time we kept seeing more of those cockroaches crawling all around our table  even though our food was good  and the prices were decent  we cannot stand the thought of bugs in our food or around our table,negative
tragically i picked this place even though the magical and impartial coin flip directed me elsewhere  with the exception of the delicious waffle fries the food was terrible  in addition  even though there were only a few other tables service was lacking  when youre given a sodiumdipped sandwich water becomes extremely necessary sadly  water appears to be a highly valued commodity since we were unable to find our server to request more  on the plus side they seem to have nightly drink specials that dont appear unreasonable despite this  i will not be back,negative
disclaimer the sushi menu is also offered at the terrible bar next door    we ordered some dumplings and sushi as appetizers for our meal dumplings appeared to be from a bargain bin and perhaps microwaved within the last four hours the sushi spicy salmon seemed like it was some kind of paste rather than fish ive eaten cheap sushi before  but this wins the award for the worst ive ever had congrats,negative
i work very close to harvest coop  so its convenient to shop when i really need something but that is the only time i will shop there after several visits  i have never encountered a cashier who would even say hello after i say it they seem to have an air of veiled contempt what is the deal with this place their prices are ridiculously high  putting them on a par with wholier than thou food at least their workers are not usually rude i hate paying for snob appeal  but obviously many others dont mind  just because a store likes to project a healthy or green image does not mean they actually are that way  nor does it mean their workers are superior to the rest of us  no thanks  i will stick to star market or foodmaster,negative
i eat a lot of burritos and i can say without hesitation that burrito max is the worst mexican i have had anywhere  ever not authentic like el pelon  not  fast and fresh like qdoba  not simple and tasty like annas taqueria there are several more satisfying options within walking distanct of maxs kenmore square location so i cant imagine any reason you would stop by,negative

as youre walking through price center at ucsd  you probably have your mind set on eating relatively healthy will it be a nice wrap from tacone  or maybe a sandwich from zanzibar but then it hits you like a slap in the face from an ex gf  that horribly enticing panda express smell   you tell yourself that this time it will be different  this time they have changed smell how good it smells the food must be that good or better boy  have you deluded yourself  the line moves quickly and soon youre in the front lets try and be healthy you tell yourself maybe you order the mixed veggies  but that second item is always the meat orange chicken or the crispy beef   in the end  it turns out the same it always does just like every time you get back with that ex of yours and youre left feeling disgusted with yourself at least with panda the regret goes away quickly and doesnt linger like the scent of bad perfume on your bedroom sheets,negative
i wish you could give negative stars to certain establishments let me tell you what happened to me at this subway on friday  may 8th  2009  as sara s already stated  there arent too many healthy options at the utc mall subway is my fare of choice because i usually want to stop at hot dog on a stick and fill myself up with some luscious lemonade and a couple sticks of fried cheesy goodness i get to the counter and tell the girl id like a turkey on wheat she plops down the meat on the bread and slides it down to the next guy for condiments and veggies now  if i told you id like spicy mustard  spinach  cucumbers  pickles and lots of black olives  would you say do you want onions on that and then would you like lettuce and finally tomatoes me thinks not  it took twice as long to get my sammich constructed because mr irefusetolistentoyoueventhoughtheresnolanguagebarrier thought maybe i had amnesia and forgot what i like on my turkey on wheat then miss obvious says is that a six inch no  its a 6ft sub theres a huge difference between 6 and 12 inches  why are you asking me when the sandwich is close enough to bite you in the jugular  im done with that subway ill drive down to the chevron station or over to miramar road to get a turkey on wheat at least i wont have to deal with people who would get zeroes on an iq test,negative
i was very disappointed in the food here the pizza was probably one of the worst i have had its so sad how they can mess up pizza i mean how do you do that had them deliver 5 pizzas and will never do it again the first slice is the only one where we could taste anything  the pizza is so thin and the amount of cheese is almost non existant as soon as you open the box it gets cold and thats it now i know pizza can taste good cold but trust me you wont even like this when its hot the sauce is super garlicy and its pretty much all thats left as a taste in your mouth when youre done  so sad there are lots of other choices for pizza  i cant imagine or even want to imagine what the other food here tastes like,negative
probably my least favorite place to dine in princeton i did have a one good experience in the large room upstairs with friends but the food has always been subpar do not order the penang curry it was watery and bland the service isnt great and the food is terrible i miss das,negative
the food is edible but not authentic chinese from what ive been told regardless of the quality  the service is terrible the only waitresscashier is almost always rude most of the items on the menu are not available at the time  and this information is always conveyed brusquely in a toobadeatelsewhere fashion  i have eaten there four times  and given the consistency of the service  will not eat there again,negative
i had lunch at lulus today after st pauls easter mass  only as a last resort because crepes parisiennes and eat unique were both closed for the day  i had two bad experiences at lulus before  but that was about a year ago  and i was hungry  the memories of past horrible food had faded gently in my mind  and i was feeling forgiving    big mistake  i ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl  and bob the boyfriend ordered ramen  the food came out fast enough  so no complaints there  but from the first bite  it was clear that things had gone horribly awry  the pork on top of the bowl looked and tasted like something a dog would gnaw on  tough  dry  and very salty  underneath  my noodles were completely unseasoned  just rice vermicelli with nothing else to speak of    as for the boyfriend  bobs ramen was technically ramen  i guess  since the noodles were ramen noodles  but instead of a savory beef or pork broth  his noodles were backstroking in miso  while this is weird and cheapass of them  i cant complain  since the broth was clearly described as miso on the menu  but the real problem was the miso broth itself  the amount of miso in it made my tongue curl  it was so salty it was almost inedible  when the waitress asked me if everything was ok  i told her plainly about the dry pork and the bland noodles  and she said yup  thats the way it comes  i was stunned and didnt know what to say  so i asked her to suggest something else  she recommended the singapore rice noodles    the singapore noodles came out after a short wait  and the noodle bowl mercifully disappeared  but then the new noodles were so heavily spiced that they were again almost inedible  certainly not bland this time  though  i have to wonder if they were messing with me  finally  we asked for to go boxes and high tailed it out of there  it was a depressing  bad experience  other notes the atmosphere is horrid loud music  completely crowded  and the waitstaff is aloof  almost bitchy  im aware that this review has turned into a bit of a rant  the fact is  as i mentioned earlier  ive had two bad experiences there before  ill spare you the details  i am hoping this review will serve as a reminder to myself in the future erin  it doesnt matter how hungry you are or how much people try to talk you into lulus  dont cave  hold out for rose tea or anything  reallyanything else  dont do it,negative
ok so i tried this restaurant based on yelp reviews and unfortunately had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life  we went on a friday night  so it was busy not sure why the service was insanely slow beyond ridiculous so brutal  also  there looked like there was only one sushi chef on a busy friday night the sushi and sashimi were well below average  both not smelling or tasting freshly  also  it wasnt a cheap place all and all i was thoroughly disappointed with the ridiculously slow service as well as the sub par food yuck,negative
mama dips has landed on my blacklist for their atrociously bad service  so many incidents over the years i cant even remember them all  rude servers  absent servers  clueless servers  ive had them all    some favorites were the time they forgot to split my check and it then took over half an hour to correct  or the time that my waitress was sobbing  throughout the visit or the time i was seated in the back dining room and had to beg for a server after 15 minutes of nothing  or the time you get the picture  it can be real hit and miss   its too bad because the food can be pretty tasty  i really like the sweet potato biscuits  fried chicken  and fried green tomatoes  a few standouts aside though  the food is average  which would be acceptable if mama dips hadnt become a tourist hotspot and increased their prices    overrated,negative
consistently mediocre  food  service  and atmosphere  ive been dining here for years  but now that there are so many other better options for indian in ch its time to move on  my waitress tonight had to run to the manager for each question i asked about the menu  basics like  is this dish for 2 people or 1 she repeatedly mumbled answers and then fetched him each time  weird  one of my questions was about the advertised wednesday bollywood nightwhen did it start  turns out that it was in full swing  which basically means they have a movie on mute on a small tv mounted over the bar where hardly any diners can see it  woo    the food is very bland and some things are downright bad  tonight it was as simple as coffee so weak it looked like tea  i ordered a sampler for my main course which came with one teaspoon to serve rice and three entrees  one  lots of scooping ill just leave it at this the food is never as good as their nearby competitors  i want to like this place  but just cant  ive blacklisted restaurants before for bad experiences  but this is the first for consistently mediocre ones,negative
wont be back we arrived at 830  a half an hour before their posted closing time we were promptly told that they were closed  and some excuse about a large party of 8 having arrived or something like that was given this did not make sense their newly expanded dining room was more than half empty id suggest putting up the closed sign promptly if you want to close early,negative
nothing to rate this establishment on beyond its service i arrived postlunch rush to a halfempty restaurant but  since i was alone  was advised id have to share a small twotable configuration with someone else and this despite the fact that there were many empty booths and ample vacant counterspace i needed a bit more room than that for the work id brought with me  but they would not seat me anywhere else   so  i left wont be coming back  either,negative
if i could give fewer stars i would  i recently ordered pad thai to go  and they put it in a styrofaom box  which the pad thai melted and i ended up eating only three bites before having to throw out the food because it tasted so horrible i have given them multiple opportunities  and i have told them about this issue getting pad thai on a normal plate isnt even good its mediocre at best try fresh side if youre interested in good food,negative
generally  i try to be nice about my reviews  but i think i just need to be honest for this one i ordered the tomato basil bisque  which i put in quotes because soup  it was not slop  maybe seriously the worst soup ive had in a long time i also ordered a grilled cheese panini with the soup  and it was almost tasteless i have no idea how you can make a grilled cheese sandwich tasteless  but i think it starts by putting barely any cheese  and maybe no butter gross maybe the other soups are better  but be prepared for an overpriced bowl of nasty soup and a tasteless sandwich,negative
my brother has autism  today  we went to rubys bbq and my brother was acting like his usual self i overheard the workers at the counter at rubys bbq at this location calling my brother retarded and weird of course after that i yelled at them i urge everyone in austin to never go to rubys bbq again the food isnt even that good and remember the r word is incredibly hurtful,negative
there was so much about the spider house that i wanted to like  free wifi not that its useful when you go for drinks  350 frozen margaritas  groovy decor  relaxed feel  etc  but  i had a miserable experience    my buddy and i get there and decide to sit outside  which was cool  first thing i noticed was the neat decor and a pretty relaxed feeling which i enjoyed  however  the taste in my mouth soon soured  after waiting around for about 10 minutes  we flagged down a waiter who let us know that he couldnt take our order because he wasnt sure  but didnt think that we were in his zone or whatever  weird  but sure send over the waiter who is supposed to  about 10 more minutes later and our waitress came over and asks us what we want  i order a margarita and my buddy asks for a beer  15 minutes later  we are drinkless and starting to get pissed  the waitress comes back and goes sorry about that but our computer is down and i forgot your order what did you want again  we give her our order again and wait about 10 more minutes and finally get our drinks    first round of drinks about halfway finished and the waitress comes back and asks us if we want another round  im excited because she came back so early  im thinking if we order now well get our drinks by the time were ready for them  so  we order another round  we literally finish the rest of our drinks and wait around for about 10 more minutes before our waitress comes back and goes  did i bring your drinks already to which we respond no  then about 5 minutes later she comes back and goes you sure i didnt bring you your drinks i could have swore i brought your drinks out  at this point  were pretty steamed  but we hold back and go nope  you didnt  finally she comes out with our drinks and we ask for our check  which we got right about the time we had polished off our second drink paid in cash to avoid sitting for another 15 minutes    all the while that this debacle was going down theyre playing this horrible indie music that literally sounded like a table saw running    needless to say  ill go to trudys across the street any night of the week to spend my money before returning to the spider house,negative
we were at lustre pearl last night  ready for some tacos my boyfriend placed the order and we waited very very very patiently while we thought they were making them a half hour later  we started to ask where our tacos were we ordered only 2 of them  mind you  and we asked a couple times and they kept saying they were on their way over the next 15 minutes  we saw no tacos leave that truck and two workers in the trailer were just standing around not doing much we decided to just ask for our money back and when we did  the guy said well make them for you right now well  you should have made them 45 minutes ago that would have been great  im sure the tacos are wonderful when you actually get them,negative
this place seems to be popular with my fellow cornellians  so i was extra disappointed when we visited  although busy  the place was not full  and two of us had to wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a host and then seated 10 more minutes passed literally  im not exaggerating time here  and we had yet to even see a waitress to ask us for drinks or anything at this point  we went back to the host  and told him we hadnt been attended to he apologized  and he himself took drink orders 5 more minutes passed  no drinks we had both ordered tap water  on top of all of this  the place was filthy floor was not vacuumed  and our table was greasy and filled with debris id love to rate the food  but after 25 minutes and no water  we left and headed to garcias  never having tried  or intending to in the future try this dump,negative
i am giving taste of thai on the commons such a low rating because of the astonishingly nasty service  i have tried multiple times now and it is always the same thing  so i cannot go back  ever again  taste of thai express is much  much better i give them a lot of business and 3 stars  if the owners care at all and if they ever read their reviews  i would respectfully urge them to evaluate their staff at the commons location   i am overly nice when i go out and i tip well i have a great amount of empathy for what service people do because i do it myself but with all the ambivalenttorude service i have now experienced in my travels  i am honestly trying to recall if i have ever been treated with such inexplicable and downright bazaar rudeness with the exception of one nice guy  the staff is weirdly angry and openly hostile do not even think of asking a simple question like  could you please leave out the peas or being so obnoxious as to order tea  believing that maybe you will receive it unless the nice guy is your server how does he stand working there dont they pool tips  taste of thai express has much  much nicer staff and better prices they are always very friendly and helpful and their delivery guys are great the food is good enough that i order frequently  but i think sticky rices is better quality if you are looking for less expensive  taste of thai express is the better value if you like the coconut milk soup tom ka gai tote makes the best for ithaca also  their pad kee mao with pork is quite good greasy  but good the pad thai is tasty inandofitself  but not the best  by a long shot i never order appetizers because they are overpriced by a couple dollars for what you get  it is like much better chinese takeout thai food  i love ithaca  but man is it overpriced we need better quality value places to eat,negative
it is a bad sign when you walk into a place and they have a sign on the table push button for service the two tables that had people in there seemed quite neglected i pushed the button and out came a nice guy  gave me a menu and asked me to sit down  i ordered the cold appetizer combo  with hummus  baba ganoush  grape leaves and taubole i am sure i misspelled most of those the waiter walks into the kitchen and comes out and tells me they are out of grape leaves i ask if i can sub falaful he went into the kitchen and came out and said they were out so i just got double hummus the food was substandard the baba ganoush had no flavor and the taubole was chopped way too coarsely i have had better hummus at vons  it is not a place i plan on going back poor service  poor food  weird set up in the dinning room,negative
this place is a shame    im normally a fan of beard papas  used to have one across the street when i lived in gardena  bliss    not bliss  however  with the one on telegraph  the custard filling was not custard filling  instead  the puff which tasted stale was injected with some sugary  watery concoction that left us with a mess in our hands  simply an unacceptable experience    notwithstanding the fact that papa dont take no mess  he left us with one on saturday night,negative
to the reviews below i will balance the rating out alright by giving one star it deserves none this will be my longest review but i really want to spare my fellow yelpers a horrible dining experience  i got drunk with the guys one night and by bestie bought me chicken and rice  the good friend that she is sadly it was mediocre if only i remembered it was from here  i would have spared muself  and my party  the pain of dining here in person  we went for a friends bday dinner after the restaurant lost his reservation they seated us in the back  and we had our usual banter planning which gay bar to hit that night  bday boy is gay  after all  so i d take one for the team  the waiter left us for 15 minutes  then after placing our orders  i had to hail him at least 5x to inquire as to how much longer wed have to wait for the order apparently the answer was an hour but i kept my temper in check  since it was his day after all  and theres only room for one diva at a table  when the food finally came  all hell broke loose they had bought out the wrong entrees for two we were a party of 10  i had ordered the chicken and rice  see above and declined to eat after the first bite the worst was my vegetarian friend who ordered the veggie burger the lettuce was burnt  a sight i have never seen in my 20 years of dining i mean  you have to be pretty determined to burn lettuce and she had asked for no condiments  but it came slathered in ketchup and some mystery sauce she sent it back and asked for a new one the waiter bought back her new order 5 minutes later  and it was the same burger wed sent back with the sauce scraped off unforgivable  the only saving grace after that was watching the table of 3 women getting drunk a table downsexuallly frustration and 5 rounds of mixed drinks never mix  but bode for free entertainment ,negative
the pizza sucks  and it is a scam against rpi students a slice of gourmet now costs 3  while for 5 at i loves you can get 2 slices and a drink they also wont take any credit cards on anything less than a 5 order  which ive heard is illegal dont go here,negative
ever since george left  my experiences there have been terrible  i went to georges with two others for breakfast a few weeks after the new owners took over the place and they seemed to have no clue how to run the business  i trumped this up to the place being new to them and decided i would try again once they settled into the place  i returned a few weeks later for breakfast and the experience was even worse    the place at the time was incredibly busy and a woman presumably one of the owners was trying to take orders at the counter while serving customers food at their tables  i ordered breakfast and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich  while waiting for our food  the woman was running around frantically trying to squeeze by people getting their coffees and bumping into chairs  i felt incredibly uncomfortable being there  after about 10 minutes  the woman came over with only my boyfriends sandwich  apparently  the grill was backed up  and it would be a few more minutes for my food  fifteen minutes passed before my breakfast came out  meanwhile my boyfriend had already finished his sandwich  while i was waiting for my food to come out  i noticed that people all around were having the same problem  half the table would get food while the other half sat there and watched them eat  i also saw three people send their food back    my order finally came out and the portion size was half of what it used to be for the same price  my eggs were also cold and undercooked  i got half way through my meal when i noticed the scrambled eggs were runny in the middle and i couldnt eat anymore  needlesstosay  the experience ended with a quick walk home and a stop in the bathroom  i would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want an upset stomach  i gave the new owners two chances  figuring they just needed to get into the groove of things  but they didnt seem to get it and unfortunately  i wont be stopping in again to see if they have figured it out,negative
its closed  ughhhhh after walking back and forth we came across this dark  dark place  fail,negative
their foods are gross  however  the place is spacious and you can enjoy watching a big tv so i would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have some korean booze and food with buddies in a quiet setting i hope the owner of ttoust will take over this place  so i can get a much better food in a better setting,negative
okay  i gave this place another try i hadnt been there in a few months its disgusting  tapioca wasnt cooked properly  so it was hard in the middle and too soft on the outside milk tea was completely bland and flavorless think brown water with some chunks of goo  gross i wont be going here again which is tragic because this was my favorite place before the owners changed ,negative
this pizza hut is pretty bad the service is super slow and the pizza doesnt taste good ,negative
what a huge disappointment this place was after reading the yelp reviews  it was like i ate ate a completely different place we went for lunch this past monday it was so bad we couldnt eat our food we left out of there feeling robbed heres the run down brisket was bland  shredded beef tasted like it had been reheated way too many times  pork had an odd taste like it was turning bad  macaroni and cheese dried out  potato salad consisted of mostly celery  and beans were flavorless i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this place hands down the worst bbq ive ever had,negative
having only seen this place from the outside i had previously decided to give it a wide berth it looks like it caters to the young plastic people of america but i finally gave it a chance  easily the worst pizza in town very bland  limp  lame decor is like mcdonalds or walmart trying to be groovy giant plastic surfing hippie and so on filthiest silverware i have ever seen at any restaurant anywhere entertainment provided by deafening fratboy singersongwriters who can neither sing nor write songs my experience there was a waking nightmare which i will shudder to recall for years to come,negative
i have tried and tried to like this place my forebears ate here  back in the day when it had a dirt floor i want to like dirtys  but i cant fool myself any more worst fries anywhere  ever  utterly limp  soaked through and through with stale grease  barely room temperature  taste lousy small malt  mediocre  cost 4 entire front dining room unbearable due to relentlessly loud and obnoxious joking of cooks this place has a primo location and tons of history to bank on  but its always nearly empty too bad,negative
okay for me to go negative publically you have to make me very unhappy  i think throwing up after i ate here for several hours counts  not to mention i was already unhappy about the dine in service having styrofoam plates and cups  the food didnt taste right and by the time i got home it was all over  i am super unhappy that the auschron recommended it dude i trusted you guys and this place was so subpar  next time im going access the street to sun hing  their decor maybe ghetto but the orange chicken is good and i have been eating there for 20 yrs and havent gotten sick  esp if i want average chinese good  you want good chinese then drive to ding ho at 183 and ohlen near the target,negative
after trying it and retrying this place sucks  the yogurt all has a powdery taste to it  the service is less than stellar despite being continuously empty  perhaps i am a bit biased because i strongly prefer real ice cream  but this play is just all kinds of fail with so many good ice cream  ice  gelati  snow cones  and other yogurt shops in austin,negative
not friendly to families if you come here with kids youll get bewildered stares  and ultimately youll not be able to sit together as family we were treated as if we were a bother on a day that wasnt even busy,negative
this place must have the largest costvalue gap in chapel hill you can count on meager  boring  and oddly repetitive dishes at truly astonishing prices the yoghurt drink for 2 is the only thing on the menu that approximates reality there is simply nothing in the food to justify the pretentious bill your server will politely deliver nothing walk down the block to the mediterranean deli for better and more ample fare at 13 the cost wont do this one again,negative
we really wanted to like this place  we are local  we eat and shop local  we want to support local business  so we had a bad meal the ruben was terrible i did not know corned beef could be so bad and the bread was worse  anyway i thought to myself that even in my own place we make mistakes and once in a while the best customer ends up with a poor meal  so we told our waitress why we did not like the food we had eaten maybe a 14 of the food served  if not an 18th  anyway she said  ok and left  that was it  it was ok with her we were served a poor meal  food is not good servers are not well trained or managed decor was nice for a quick service restaurant highly over priced for the quality of the food served  with so many other wonderful local choices black dogs bbq  crane ally  timpones pizza  ricks bakery  cheese  crackers sandwiches and chocolates i have no reason to ever return,negative
the wife and i just came back from hanabi  i hate to give a one star review  but im going to do it here  the food was subpar  but not onestar bad  we ordered a sashimi plate  the chu toro  spicy tuna rolls  seaweed salad  miso soup  none of it was above average  but the chu toro was so chewy we couldnt eat it  on the plus side  it wasnt that pricy at 7  so we felt ok leaving it  the spicy tuna was a little unbalanced  with a smidge too much chili and not quite enough mayonnaise im no mayonnaise fan  but it needs some for texture  some of the rolls that other customers ordered did look very good  but what really made the experience bad was the service  they had two servers and one sushi chef on a friday night  yet they proceeded to seat 30 customers  inside and outside  rather than limit the flow to a manageable number at the door  we had to ask for items  water  check  etc  multiple times   the guy at the table next to us was ignored so many times finally he got really angry and complained to a guy who looked like the owner  who looked totally unsympathetic and pawned him back on the server  another table in the middle of the restaurant started getting angry as well theyd been waiting nearly an hour for their food  we couldnt get a server to take our check because the restaurant was in nearrevolt and the servers were frantically trying to deal    but what was the owner doing  well what would you do  if you said try to clean and set up empty tables so that i could seat more people while avoiding interaction with my customers  then congratulations  you get one gold star  and so does hanabi,negative
is it me or does bobby already have too much money he doesnt deserve more of mine he has an interesting concept enough i think i ordered wrong cause my burger sucked it was too small and burnt i know that sign out there for the weak hearted was for me the one that fears bacterial infections from uncooked red meat   the service was very patient with me so thanks overall too many signs  very confusing the minute you walk it there is the overwhelming graphics of the larger than life menu adhered to the wall those designer out there will like the decor but if youve been smoking too much hash before entering this little establisment you might sht your pants too many options to mess up  just give me a burger the seating if that is limitedyoull have to share at one point with some upenn or drexel fool sharing tables with strangers sometimes gets annoying i never liked that about the melrose dinner either why should i share i avoid septa for that reason  lol just kidding ok this food is lack luster bob  tell me do you not care anymore chipotle doesnt always go with every meal,negative
when you goto this place you gotta realize your in the suck upenn kids as far as the eye can seesweating through the walls  making you itch  when you walk in  the bar area is set up a little funny  its a square bar  but on the back half of the square theres a openminikitchengrillprep stationthing going on but its not like a classy japanese steakhouse openprepstation this is more like a  hey  whats that dirty looking fat guy in raggedy clothes doing with those potskinda station which left me kinda skeptical about what the main kitchen area looks like but anywho  me and the girl got the menu and everything on it looked pretty acceptable  the soup was more than decent  and the greek plate had an out of control amount of feta cheese on it is that good or bad  the girl got the marinated tofu pita and said it was eh and by eh she meant dry and not worth 9 beans it might be one of the better places to eatdrink on upenn campus  but since upenn is a joke  thats not saying much  well probably make it back again since west philly in general is pretty weak when it comes to dining out but im not gonna cut off my tongue with industrial scissors if we dont  alrite   this place used to have three stars  but i just dropped it down to 1  and im completely done here  ive been here atleast 3 other times since the initial reveiw and was disappointed everytime  ugh ,negative
if i believed in a god  i would damn him for creating a being capable of making an establishment like greek lady  this place makes me want to have sex with a chainsaw   i came into this place thinking i was going to be served imitation greek food  but i was dead wrong i was served imitation greek food prepared by a upenn kid usually when i goto a ethnic place to eat i expept someone of that ethnicity to me making the foodmy logic is obviously flawed in this respect one of the nightmarish creations i attempted to eat here was the vegetarian gyroi should of ordered a priest to come with it because this abomination was something that i couldnt handle alone  from the outside it looked alright but on the inside learked something much fouler this vegetarian thing was basically french friesyes  french fries saturated in cucumber yogurt  a hefty ice cream scoop worth lettuce tomato onion inside a pita it was revolting   and i had to toss it  the pepsi i bought was delicious though worth the trip,negative
this is the most unpleasant place ive ever been to in my life  ok  perhaps this reflects on my sheltered existence  but it also is based on the fact that  while waiting patiently to be seated at a table and minding my own business  i was accused by a hostile and frightening waitress of trying to trip her as she went past me  who does this  i am exceedingly nice to waiters and waitresses  bc i know it is a tough job  and i most definitely did not trip this person  i figured i could clear things up with her  but when i went up to the waitress to try to smooth things over  she yelled at me about what a bad person i was for tripping her  what  i mean  i know it is difficult to work at a college hangout like that  but what is wrong with you  who raised you  i was so shocked by this insane and random accusation that we basically left right after that  the person in charge of the wait list watched the whole thing and didnt say a word to me  if mad mex were the last restaurant left  i wouldnt eat there  i just cant believe that restaurants  even college bars  allow their customers to be abused like that  unbelievable  they really do put the mad in mad mex,negative
long wait times they should change their policy and let people share tables like they do in european restaurants  we had the pancakes and steak and eggs meals the pancakes were not tasty at all had a funky taste steak was overcooked and a little tough not sure it was worth the wait,negative
he says  horrible  simply horrible  if your version of chinese food involves a chicken tenders  b red sauce  and c practically raw vegetables then you my friend are in luck  le ahn features all 3  in every one of their chicken dishes  i have had food from there a handful of times twice on my own  because i decided to give a different kind of entree a shot  and twice because different friends had heard a chinese cart around here was good and i had forgotten that this was so bad  beware  steer clear  thar be monsters  she says interesting gingerbased sauce poured on entree  im not an expert on chinese food  but i havent heard of it resembling what this cart serves  for all you health nuts  however  a lot of things are steamed  i think  good luck  his response steamed  subtly steamed,negative
my recommendation what are you doing on this page  this place doesnt exist anymore  this place is closed down now so dont go wandering around ucsd looking for it  alsofood sucked even when it was open,negative
im playing devils advocate here  i know yall think this place is the best thing since sliced bread  especially if its ordinary bread priced 3 times higher than in other stores  but a dose of reality  please  hey  if im looking for organic yak cheese made by hand in nepal by tibetan monks  im going to whole foods  but conventionally grown grapes at 5lb when you can get the same at ralphs for 2 come on  my favorite is the 12lb of peets coffee for 10 when you can buy a full lb at that price next door   and dont get me started on beer  almost all of their beers are available elsewhere at 2 less a 6pack  its pretty sad when seveneleven is cheaper for beer  another huge problem i have with whole foods is their labelling  isnt the whole idea behind this place supposed to be attention to health  so why do almost none of their prepared foods have the dietary contents listed  just because something is organic doesnt mean its good for you  it just means the coroner wont find as many toxins in your cold carcass brought to its demise by a tuna sandwich that had 42grams of fat in it  so i guess part of what bothers me is the attitude of whole foods  it just seems pretentious and insulting beyond belief  im going to sell you the same thing you can get elsewhere and im going to charge you so much more for it youre going to actually believe its better than you can get elsewhere   take a little trip to trader joes or henrys  both of which have organic foods  correct labels  and much better attitudes  having said all that  i really do like whole foods burrito bar     update   before i was playing devils advocate  now im serious  just as i found something at whole paycheck that was actually almost worth it  the burrito bar see last comment above  theyve now stepped over the line  they just switched to charging burritos by weight   there is a whole assortment of stuff you can have put in there and the people behind the counter who are great would make me these fantastic burritos   and they were 599  not bad   but once  by accident  they weighed my burrito at the checkout and it came to almost 12  but most of that weight are things like beans  which are about 1ton  so i just went there and now they are charging by the pound    from a marketing standpoint  this is a disaster  dont they understand that by allowing variable size burritos to be made  they are on the winning side of the ticket  its the all you can eat principle at work  its what the entire midwest food service industry is based on  some people eat a lot more than they should  but some people only eat a little  on average  it all works out  but that wasnt the best part  they are now also charging for condiments  i kid you not  when you buy a sandwich and want to put mustard on it  or soy sauce on your sushi  they charge you by weight for the condiments   they want you to put them in a little paper cup and weight it  pardon my french but you can blow me  there was no way i was not going to talk to the manager about this  and thats when i started to truly despise this place  the manager said that people were abusing the burrito service by putting too many things on their burritos what the fuck does that mean  i reminded her that not only do they advertise that you can put all those things on your burrito  but the customers arent making the burritos  her employees are  but apparently all she had learned in whole foods training school was how to say im sorry you feel that way   but her take on the condiments was truly outstanding   as my buddy d told her  even mcdonalds gives away free condiments  but she said blaming the customers again that people were abusing that privilege too because they take stuff off the shelves and use that as condiments  hey  thats not a problem with the condiments  thats just stealing  i told her  thats a security issue  then she said that they are losing money on the condiments  so d asks her  well  how much extra money are you losing by now requiring people to use all those little cups  and thats not exactly environmentally sound  is it  her well thought out response to this was im sorry you feel that way and thats when i realized she was just full of shit  any place that is charging approximately double the price for the same items you can buy at trader joes is not losing money  theyre just losing customers like me  and their arrogance is unbounded,negative
i havent been back to this place in ages see first review for reason but perhaps a few years was enough time to make a few improvements  but it was not to be   for the appetizer we ordered the spinach cheese dip  this may have been the worst appetizer ive ever had  it was a bowl of liquid cheese  there were some green specks i can imagine might have been spinach and a very few pieces of something at the bottom of the bowl  but really it was just a slimy mess  it was horrific  for my main dish i thought that id ordered the ahi sandwich  which i assumed was a big piece of ahi  because thats what it is everywhere else on the planet  but it was just a pile of low grade ahi scraps obviously trimmed away from a real piece of ahi  and the magician in the kitchen had found a way to extract all flavor from those scraps  it tasted like pegboard  and for 12 do me a favor an throw that garbage on some kind of real bread  not the cheap hamburger bun like i used to use for picnics  now that i live downtown  my beer palette has been significantly honed by the many great beer venues neighborhood  etc  the ipa on the cask  no less was so thin  flavorless  and weak that it was pretty close to a pint of flat cocacola  just awful  and just for a little emphasis  my beer came cold and my friends beer came warm  and sticking with their policy of denial  the waitress said well  i saw the bartender pour them one after another  this place really is the ultimate in corporate restaurant mediocrity,negative
one of the first bands i ever heard on the radio when i was young was styx and i figured that must be rock music because they had guitars and a drum  of course  it didnt take long before i realized that they were as close to a rock band as kenny g is to a jazz musician and now id rather listen to someone jackhammering a cat than a styx album  live and learn  right  so just because bread is round and has a hole in it  doesnt make it a bagel  bagels are by definition boiled in water  and they need to be made fresh in the morning  einstein bros bagels are neither  theyre just round  stale bread  if youre having trouble wrapping your head around this  do the following test  by way of analogy  go to piattis and order pasta  but bring along a can of chef boyardee spaghetti os  when your meal comes  take a bite  then take one from chef bs can and tell me you think thats spaghetti,negative
they have to put the word mexican in their name because you would never guess it by taste  hell  you wouldnt even guess it was food if the items werent shaped like things you vaguely recognize from real restaurants   and could you design a place with worse ambience if youre in the bar area it feels like youre eating in someones attic  or barn way to make the most of the prime location in la jolla next to ucsd  which is already a barren wasteland for restaurants  id crawl through the four lanes of traffic to eat at the chevron station across the street before i ate here  hey  can i have the stale chips with pureed tomato salsa to start  then some nondescript flavorless meatlike substance wrapped up in a desiccated leathery tortilla  followed by a gigantic bowl of margarita mix to wash it down  suhweet,negative
worst persian restaurent in la,negative
it is my opinion that this place make some pretty freakin bad pizza  and bad salad now granted  ive only had pizza delivered  so maybe its better when you have it in the restaurant my company had some pizza delivered  and i had a piece of the buffalo chicken pizza which first of all looked completely unappetizinglike it had been sitting out for a while and congealed  and second  tasted awful   just horrible  it actually tasted to me  like someone had dumped a bunch of chemicals on the pizza instead of buffalo flavoring   the salad that came with our delivery was an entire tray filled to the brim with iceburg lettuce  on top of the huge pile of iceburg lettuce were about 6 slices of tomato  cucumber and green pepper  that thats it  that can hardly qualify as a salad to top it all off  i ate this pizza at 12 noon and my stomach has been killing me ever since  i am convinced that there is something wrong with the buffalo pizza   justdont go here  there is no point when there are so many other places that are so very much better,negative
bad dont even deserve 1 star but i had to in order to continue with my post  i go to starbucks all the time  at fresh pond  church st  broadway  mass ave towards porter  or kendall sq  never to this one and well keep it that way i visited this particular one  on saturday 426 in the early afternoon  after a light walk in the rain  thought i would treat myself shouldve gone to one of my regular spots it was a typical day at starbux  a short line but many people hanging out i ordered the new pike place blend but decaf with steamed milk  a misto  if you will ive been getting decaf for a while now since i recently developed a strange reaction to caffeine due to asthma and im currently pregnant i know that no decaf is really decaf but i need to regulate my intake well  someone else ordered the same misto but regular  made me nervous when the drinks were called out  i asked the barista if she was sure mine was the decaf  she answered confidently yes and  ms regular misto took her drink i  still not convinced  lifted the cup to see what was marked on the cup like every starbux does to identify the drinks  but nothing was marked sign number 2 i didnt want to be a pain and have them make me a new one  but ive learned my lesson now i drank it  walked home and started palpatating my breathing was erratic  i was shaking   and i had to take a medicine to counteract the effects i was having it was scary i made sure i called the manager the next day when i was more calm but of course the manager gave a insincere apology and his voice didnt show any emotion i was so so so disappointed i will never return there  i have sent an email to the corporate office because you expect so much from them im not even sure i want to go back to any starbux now  maybe i should just stick to the local little cafes and save money at the same time,negative
yuck anyone that thinks this is ice cream has never had any being pregnant and having so many cravings  my husband and i have learned we must act fast when  one comes on  so we happen to be on a walk through harvard sq and walked by lizzys  went in and notices blackberry ice cream  yum purchased the half gallon to have some later at hometook a few spoonfuls and eeewwwww its just cream no flavor whatsoever its just cream with food coloringand they charge you like its haagendazs  thats what i get for going to a little guy or gal in this case for ice cream ill stick to baskin robbins if im ever confronted with a craving for ice cream in harvard sq again,negative
we ended up here after finding that all of the other places we wanted to go to were full  dont be fooled by the romantic tables at the front of the restaurant with table cloths and a nice view  the interior tables were very close together with cold metal surfaces  the food was soso and definitely not worth the price  portion size was small  service was good  you can do much better in princeton for the same money,negative
the mexican food is not so good the spices are off and oddly mixed the quality of the food is ok at best the food is prepared without gloves  which makes me uneasy,negative
i was dying for this place to open  its located right between my apartment and the office  ive given it three chances and was disappointed each time  the atmosphere is great  its clean and airy and the people are generally very friendly  its the food and coffee that could be much better  in fairness  i only ordered the toasted bagel and cream cheese and a latte each time  similar to my experience at many cafes downtown  they do not know how to choose or prepare a good bagel  why does every place insist on toasting it and then covering it while hot in foil  dont they know its going to turn to mush  im not sure it mattered anyway as its more like a hamburger bun than the way a bagel is meant to be  the latte was nothing special  id rather walk out of my way to find something better  why ruin a morning ritual with bland food,negative
this place has got the shittiest service on planet earth most of the staff that work there are either rich hipster kids looking for another source of income to snort their coke or retired rockstars who still talk about that one big show they played most of the staff here are rude and dont pay attention to you if you are not wearing the latest line from american apparel i came to spiderhouse before they had a full bar and had their shitty wait staff  it was way better back in the days where there were no pretentious pricks stareing at what you are wearing back in the day  you came to spiderhouse  ordered your drink inside and just took it outsideinside to chill now  if you try to order inside  i am usually directed by the rude staff that there are waiterswaitress outside to take our orders ive been forced to go outside several times and one time i literally sat there for 30 minutes before anyone paid us any attention this just doesnt happen to me  it happens to all of my friends and other people that have been there ive had several friends that have worked at spiderhouse and it is fair for me to say that they spend most of their time chatting to their friends who came to spiderhouse instead of taking orders from customers   the only positive about the current spiderhouse that i still like is their design its very well done and they do have good vegetarian food but if you are vegan there is not much of an option their alcoholic drinks are good  i suggest the spider cider with a shot of rum in it as far as regular drinks  my favorite is their raspberry sunset,negative
chicken in my vegetarian dish,negative
yuck this place sucks the food is gross  ranging from tasteless and soggy to overly salted and just nasty the only times that i go to this place is as an unwilling participant in some sort of group outing even their drinks are gross   if you are a college student who wants to get so wasted that you dont even taste your food because believe me you dont want to then by all means go to trudys   the service too  is just ok,negative
closed in 2011 pulled up stakes in the middle of the night leaving staff  longtime customers in the lurch theres a rumor they may be reopening one of the closed stores soon i wont be patronizing them ever again  btw  this app wont allow you to post with 0stars  i tried,negative
i was having dinner with my roommate and when she left to go to the bathroom the waitress started a staring contest with me wtf,negative
i actually finally complained after a checker didnt use a cupon that was on an item i bought  he said since i didnt present it to him he didnt ring it up with it  the customer service person said the manager was busy  i told him he just said sorry  didnt ask my name or number for her to get back to me  i then felt that he wouldnt bother to tell the manager so i wrote them a note  the manager never responded to my complaint and so i did go to a different safeway  to all you yelp people i got much better treatment by staff at the safeway at rosovelt location so if you want one close by go to that one  its bigger  cleaner  friendlier staff and i think ill go there when i go instead of the other one to safeway  just really sad the service at this store  dont waist your money and shop somewhere else,negative
id eyed this place for several months and wanted to try it  but for one reason or another did not  well  i finally did and wished i had walked on by  it was one of the worst values ever  i thought morimotos was bad for the money this place was worse and the prices were near morimotos in philly  my seafood teriyaki was around 21 and it had 4 jumbo shrimps the best thing on the plate  and 5 scallops which you can tell that it was really one sliced into 5 pieces  and 3 slices of white fish each about the size of 2 fingers  it came with blanched vegetables that were difficult to eat because it was basically raw with no taste  and the string bean spine had not been peeled  so i had to spit it out  if you like bland tasteless food or need to eat such because you are nursing an ulcer  this is the place for you  uhg  never again  nice little cozy place though  thats about it  almost forgetthe mango lobster salad for 10 was good but you only get about 1 index finger sized of lobster  the salad comes in a martini glass so imagine how little you get   lobster prices these days are crazy low  i mean you can get a whole cooked 125 lb lobster in chinatown for 10  wtf,negative
i only come here once in a blue moon  this is one of my least favorite restaurants because the food isnt that great  however  i always like to come here once a year or two just to remind myself why i dont like coming here and eating here couple days ago reminded me again the reasons  so  my boyfriend and i came here because we were both hungry  we havent ate all day and we wanted food quickly we didnt want fast food and we wanted to go to a sit down restaurant  knowing how busy places get around 7ish  we decided to come here because in la jolla  this place is the least packed restaurant  we even drove by bjs  tgif  etc    our wait on a friday night at 7 pm was 25 mins  as we were waiting i saw a table get cheddar cheese fries 695  295 additional for chili  seriously that much just for chili  totally overpriced and boy did it look good  so when we finally got seated that is what i ordered  i also ordered a pina colada drink 7  my boyfriend ordered sliders  7 and mai tai drink 7  as we were sitting there waiting for our food it came out 20 minutes later yes granted the fact that the place was busy  it doesnt justify the fact that it took 20 minutes just to get two appetizers  on top of that  it took another 5 minutes  so a total of 25 minutes  to get our drinks because they forgot about it  wow seriously bad service   in addition to the lag in service  our food was gross  my fries was not what i saw before  it was stale  some were hard crispy  cold  and there were little cheese  the cheese also was melted but it was cold and hard  you could tell they left it out for a while before they served it  the sliders were okay i wasnt as impressed it was only okay because we made it to be okay by adding more sauce and etc  overall for a meal that was 30 its wasnt satisfying  update 1216  i was going through my pictures because i love looking at them i know im silly and i so happened to check islands to see my food pictures and they took it off their yelp site is that even possible if so   how rude they only kept one persons picture that gave them a good rating   on top of the worst service and bad food  this really topped it  poor sportsmanship   update 1231  okay so they put my pictures back up  thanks islands i very much appreciate it,negative
bad business move   i was a regular at doodles until today  i talked this place up to friends  coworkers  and family i really did heartdoodles now  they jacked up their prices and changed their menu unfortunately  they changed the quality of the flavoring too on top of that  the guy behind the counter was rude this all adds up to not good sadly  this will most likely be my last visit to doodles ,negative
ive ordered from sliders twice and both times i was really disappointed  the first time  they screwed up my order  twice i was let down by the menu to begin with  since one of the best parts of belgian fries is the sauces  but for the most part their selections are very ordinary plain ketchup  bbq  hot sauce  etc between my friends and i  we ordered burgerssliders which were just decent  fries  a number of different sauces so wed have variety despite the options being quite ordinary  and were delivered a completely different selection of sauces than what we had ordered i called sliders to request that they deliver the correct sauces and they delivered a bag with our order correctly handwritten on it yet with another seemingly random collection of incorrect sauces inside we gave up the fries were bland and oily anyway and bore little resemblance to authentic belgian fries ive eaten in the past  the second time  i tried to give sliders another chance by ordering a burger and a slider  since the burger had been the only decent component of my meal the first time  and it was awful the bottom of the burger was not only sort of charred  but absurdly  horribly salty i love salt but i found this barely edible a burger this bad from a cheap burger place wouldnt be as disappointing  but this was 5 to start plus they charge you extra for cheese and some other toppings including the jalapenos  which were not very good jalapenos  all heat  no flavor the slider was a little better but nothing special  and seemed more like a tiny burger than a proper slider anyway overall  too much money for really lousy food,negative
do not come here if you are in a large group  the food is okay  as usual  but the service was so shitty   we came in a large group and were pressured to sit down and get our orders taken for a fixed gratuity  of course fine  whatever but when we asked the waitress if she could split the bill amongst 4 cards as we had no cash on us  it was like asking for her firstborn she informed us in this nasty  awful tone that she had told us if we wanted to pay separately we were to do it at the counter when she did no such thing and that she would do it this time but next time we had better at which point we politely told her how much we appreciated it and handed her our cards uh  hello  werent you the one who chirpily told us to inform you if we wanted it split a different way as you handed us the bill stupid wench never coming here again for my mediocre pasta ill take gypsys gruff cashier guy anyday,negative
800 for a burger combo and no cheese   cmon son,negative
i had the misfortune of going to this restaurant for pancakes they were swimming in frying oil  all shiny they were very very disgusting i ordered tea  which meant lipton in lukewarm water before ordering pancakes  i asked for eggs but changed my mind when i found out that they do not have whole wheat toast what kind of breakfast place only has white bread my server was nice the ambiance was stuck up and pretentious with nothing good to show for it i live above this place  and im never going back,negative
im giving this place 1 stars only because i want this review to stand out maybe the business can read it and do something about it   the bagels here are great  they are absolutely delicious  theres no doubt about thattheir cream cheese is also of high quality   but my problem has been during the ordering phase of the bagels about 40 of the time  ive received a misunderstood order either the bagel or the cream cheese was wrong the staff doesnt speak much english  and the way they have organized the line is quite inefficient that it becomes very painful to order for example today  it took me 10 minutes to get a small container of veggie cream cheese because the staff kept telling me to order the cheese over there they kept ping ponging me for cream cheese the service is awful  but the bagels are the best ive tasted in manhattan,negative
the food was not good  for all of the pretense and egotism  they serve animals on the menu that should not be considered food  even by carnivores  i have to say i had high hopes for gather  but after following their menu for a while  i was sorely disappointed,negative
different strokes for different folks i get it some people like their pizza ny style others like theirs loaded with goodies personally  i like mine fatty and filling my food mantra  really but i truly dislike fat slices brand of fatty and filling my pepperoni slice was all tasteless bread  cheap cheese  grease and no sauce or flavor to speak of and lets not even discuss the disruptive bowel movements that followed my lunch here not worth saving a few dollars when you have other cheap options on telegraph  also janky as hell i love me a grungy place  but the foods gotta be good  ya dig,negative
cheap  yet ohsotasteless  save your 2 and go somewhere else  i had the falafel  and it was cold and tasted like nothing  or burnt  yuck  i also had the tabbouleh  and it was weird  it was more cucumber and tomato bits than actual tabbouleh  along with a shitload of parsely  cheapoh  i might try a meatsome kebob  but after that tanks like i expect it to  i will never venture here again  plus  the counter people were dicks aug 26 2008  this place is clearly for poor college students with no money and even less taste    aside rant i have to say  i fucking hate how less than mediocre restaurants survive in big places  where there are enough people with money or bad taste to frequent them  even though the food tastes like shit  fuck you college students  ugh,negative
i am not very sure why people come here  you are in berkeley and there are a million other choices to make  even regarding indian food  and for some reason i felt compelled to walk through the doors  i might have given this place 2stars based soley on taste  but the guy at the counter was rude  there was no atmosphere which i wasnt expectingbut i digress  and the portions were smaller that i have had for similar prices at other  better  restaurants  did i mention to cockroach hanging out on the trash can on the way to the bathroom  maybe the reason i didnt eat the food was because i lost my appetite  i wont be coming back,negative
overpriced and pretentious  this is gotta be a joke  right  how could berkeley students call this best burgers  fries  the airbaked fries taste like cardboard  the burgers are healthy  with the whole wheat buns and all  but they charge 75 cents to refill your soda wtf free refills are standard now  dickwads  next time ill find the nearest in n out  or maybe trek a little farther to that great little burger joint in el cerrito,negative
this place was terrible bad decor and bad lighting aside  the food was pretty bad one of us had the bulgogi  which was oversweet and pretty fatty i had the grilled mackerel  which was clearly frozen  dry and chewy the kids shared the japchae  which was soupy and blah the miso soup was emptyjust miso and scallions the one nice part was that they gave us shumai on the house for the girls overpriced toohad we paid for the 6 shumai  it would have been 695 bulgogi was 1895 wont be back,negative
had the same experience as the other two reviewers this morning  sadly we woke up craving pancakes  and since our kitchen is packed to move  we decided to give it a try we were lucky enough to get a table quickly  but had to snag a passing waitress after 10 minutes to get menus the kids got chocolate milk  which was not wellstirredforgivable i had the eggs benedict  and was sorely disappointed by the thomas english muffin  thin hollandaise that tasted like it was powdered mix  all topped with dried parsley flakes the 2 slices of applewood bacon were okay  dont most places give you 3 my partner had french toast  which was flavorless the 2 pieces of brown n serve sausage were sent back  as they were burnt the replacements were devoured by my younger daughter  just like the brown n serves we have at home  for less money our older daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes  which were more like crepesthey were edible  just nothing to write home about   service was pretty bad  the guy owner seemed annoyed about having to seat people at one point  after having to feed our younger daughter 3 clementines because the food took so long  she had dropped a piece  which the owner picked up with a glower   needless to say  we wont be back  i wish id have stayed home and unpacked the measuring cups and made my own pancakes,negative
i loved bite mi when it first opened  ive never had any other vietnamese sandwiches  so for the price  i thought it was great    okay  but today  and somebody please respond and tell me it was some vegetable that resembles hair  but today  i got the bar b que pork  or chargrilled as its now called  and i noticed stringy  hairlike things  at first i thought it was just the pork shredding  then i thought it must be some sort of leafy vegetable sprout  but i finally pulled one out for closer inspection  and it was a coarse  short hair  black at the tip and blondish brown on the other side  and i pulled out like four more  short  stiff hairs off the top of my meat  was this pork hair  what was i eating  i get that  in the scheme of things  its really not any more gross than eating meat as a whole  but its the idea of how they may be preparing their food that really got to me  i didnt really want to think too much about it  so i just threw the rest away  two hours later i have a bad stomach ache  likely not related to pig hairs  but perhaps linked to some other nefarious cooking practices  i am very open to someone enlightening me as to what it possibly was in my sandwich  i still cannot believe it was tufts of piggy  the cashier was really friendly  though,negative
i am sorry  the service here is always awful  and im used to it  but about ten months ago i had the worst waitress she forgot to take our orders  she didnt put our orders in right away  our food took forever to get  we never saw her after that  well you would think  ten months later that waitress would be gone  fired  kaput  removed from the ranks of kerby lane after what is probably a very lengthy process of pushing out the crap judging by how consistently awful our servers are  oh no  though  we had her again  but i didnt look toward our night with dread  at least this time she was chipper and pleasant  so who knows  it could have been an off night our previous time  turns out  it wasnt  after quickly taking our drink order and very quickly bringing them out  we needed more then 45 seconds to look at the menu  she promised shed be back  15 minutes later i was pulling dollars out of my purse to pay for our drinks and leave  right as i was about to put it on the table she came rushing up  apologizing  she took our order  but then  instead of putting in our order  she took the order of someone who just walked in  they wanted coffee  so she obliged and got it for them  then she took other peoples orders  then she chilled in the back for awhile  and then a oh shit look crossed her face and it got put in  20 minutes later  our food arrived  of course  she put the order in wrong  meat instead of the veggie option for the pasta  the kitchen yells at her  she is heard audibly apologizing  she continues to apologize to us  1015 minutes go by  and the new meal arrives  except it isnt new  the pasta is hardened and dried along the edges of the dish  and the mushroom is the only thing piping hot  they had simply taken the chicken off and replaced it with mushrooms  is that even legal i dont care if it is  its stupid and gross  food sat out for 15 minutes getting gross  and then not to mention who knows what our dietary restrictions could have been  that is unacceptable  i dont want food to go to waste  but regardless  if kerby didnt employ such dependably awful workers maybe this place could be a little better  i am never going back to kerby lane  and man  its been a long time coming,negative
ok  another bad geovantis experience  again  this time i ordered a famous calzone however  the servbice is still sooo slow aprrox 15 mins after my order  i asked the guy on the cashier about the situation  and he told me back itll be ready in 2 mins and after another 15 mins  he said the calzone is ready gee  also  i do not recommend you to go there for a dinein dinner  coz people usually have a party in downstairs and make noise your dinner would become a disaster  ps the taste of calzone is nearly perfect  but it doesnt change my thoughts about this place  thumbs down again unfortunately,negative
jumping on the tart frozen yogurt bandwagon swirlberry is the alsoran in the ann arbor area  i sampled the blueberry and lemonade flavors both were grainy and neither were tart they tasted mostly sweet with hints of real lemon and blueberry flavors the lemonade flavor was pink  the concept is selfserve and you pay by weight only one largesize cup is provided very easy to overindulge without realizing it the lack of choice could lead to waste  the soft serve machines and topping bar looked neat and well maintained  the state street location is cramped and painted in headache inducing colors the dining area is up a short flight of stairs and i didnt see any wheelchair access music was loud when i visited so conversation with friends may be difficult  i will stick with yogobliss,negative
my partner and i have finally learned our lesson and stopped going even when the urge for seafood is strong the real seafood company is main streets seafood themed restaurant its not so much for eating as it is for looking the last time we went was on a friday and even on a friday my selection was not fresh maybe it was because it took so long to get to the table every time ive been there i have felt unwelcome and i leave thinking i would have had a better meal at red lobster,negative
i had the grilled cheese with bacon  tomatoes  and grilled onions  it was okay 2 points for that i asked for no butteroil on the bread and they listened 5 points for that  i am not a fan thick fat french fries minus points for that my friend had the ruben sandwhich  she said it was good  but i think it looked nasty the food is average prices are average the drinks are weak i had two jack and diets and my friend had  several seagram and diets and they were all weak we just want a good drink they did not know how to make a whiskey drink or they are just being cheap if you go here just order beer i will never go back here i ordered whiskey because it was halloween and i wanted a real drrrinnk  and their drinks were like cola minus minus points for weak weak drinks on halloween cmon now,negative
if i can give negative stars  i would   where did this place get their stars   first  their sangria is from cvs or costco the kind you buy at a grocery store premade then they cut up some orange slices and thats it   their brie cheese is cold and nasty  crackers are the kind you eat when you are pregnant or feeling sea sick   this place is a joke,negative
i am astounded  appalled  and flabbergasted that people would review this place highly honestly  im not being overly critical its just that im chinese ive come to this place  several timesnot by choice group events  and every single experience here has been disappointing the wonton soup that comes with the meal is just water and lotsa pepper and the wonton ill save my breath for that the kungpao chickn is redand by that you know that its not made correctly not even spicy just sweet and sour all over sweet and sour sweet and sour sweet and sour i know i know  its cheap and its fast what can i expect but honestly  thththat does not mean it can taste like this  runs away sobbing,negative
this store is a good study in how a culmination of small things makes a big difference basically  this is a poor mans panera i really want to like it since i live in the area and theres no panera nearby  but after a few visits ive written the place off most of the problems have been documented alreadytasteless soups  poor staffing  sovieterastyle bread counters  untidynessbut the main thing is that it all adds up to a place i dont want to spend much time in perhaps other stores are better ive noticed some variation in panera quality too  but nothing that has sunk as low as this store,negative
this was my first time going to an atlanta bread company  and i must say that i was really disappointed with this place  first of all  it seemed that every table i saw was dirty and needed to be cleaned as well as the seats  i ended up ordering the chargrilled chicken pesto panini and it was not good at all  there was very little chicken in it  and the pesto was not very flavorful  i also order the pasta salad  and that was disappointing as well  the salad was mediocre  the free internet was not working  and the list goes on  as you know  first impressions are everything  and i dont think i want to ever go back to an atlanta bread company,negative
i went here and this place looks like it is closed for business  the sign was not up anymore,negative
of all of the jamba juices ive been to in the east bay ie all of them  this one is by far the worst as far as customer service every one of their employees seem lazy  miserable and rude   its 700pm and youve already shut down your carrot juice machine even though you close at 800pm and therefore cant make carrot juice too lazy to clean it again   oh please  ill just goto the emeryville one  where theyd be happy to make me a damn carrot juice a minute before they close,negative
ew  i was sitting there reading quietly downstairs towards the front of the cafe  when all of a sudden at the corner of my eye  i see something move i thought maybe it was just me hallucinating but when i did a doubletake  it was a mouse  i immediately hopped out of my chair along with my belongings and left this place for good this place is obviously a dirty shithole  im sure theyre not the only place around berkeley infested with mice  but come on now  if you have mice lurking around there  imagine what lurks in your food   gross,negative
i came here for a chicken vindaloo and all i left with was a stomach ache and a whole lot of toilet action,negative
queue the violins  because this is a sad one  for our one year anniversary  my man and i decided to celebrate at upstairs on the square  we were so jazzed about the lauds they had received on their vegetarian tasting menu and couldnt wait to indulge in too many courses and much champagne  i booked the reservation on open table with a note that we were celebrating an anniversary and would like a quiet table  with the highest of hopes  we arrived in harvard square and were sat at a table in the middle of the room  i asked to be moved  but it was no use  as that night wassports trivia night   the dining room with the tasting menu was closed for the private party and we were forced to endure drunken idiots on one side and a loud trivia announcer on the other  to add insult to injury  the food was awful  ive only heard good things  but my striped bass was nothing but fishy  while my bfs pasta was hardly cooked at all crunchy  we had to laugh and give in to the idea thatd wed simply need a redo on the romantic evening and that it will be hard for us to even think about going back to upstairs  my main gripe is this  its cool if they have a sports trivia event  and most of the people there were enjoying it  but if i ask for a romantic table  call me and let me know that that evening will be utterly unromantic  perhaps if they had paid a little more attention to the reservation request  they would not have lost this ladys interest,negative
mkay long story short  the broad i dealt with at the counter has a demon first she takes my order  which was for a lasagna slice and a drink i paid with discresh hey sc people who know what that is and it is  i guess  a lengthy process of swiping and punching things in so she gives me the receipt to sign and then says it will be out in a minute and that was it so after a beat  im like and  my drink and shes like i didnt charge you for a drink as if thats my fault then  upon realizing id be using discresh again she angrily goes just forget it and gives me what amounted to a free watereddown sprite because the frustration of punching in another discresh order was clearly too much for her fragile psyche  if that wasnt bad enough  she brings my lasagna to my table and its hard and cold in the middle except for the melted cheese on top disgusting  boooooooooooooo,negative
ive been twice now  with high hopes only to be dramatically let down pasta roma  you do not impress me not at all people say its cheap but for the quality of the food you get  i think its expensive the marinara sauce is boring  the salad is far from fresh  and the chicken in the chicken parm sandwich i had was thin  tasteless  and dry you know what else is thin  tasteless  and dry thats right  cardboard with a million restaurants on fig  i cant imagine coming here again,negative
dont ever order a javatogo from this coffee bean i have ordered on three separate occasions for our office meetings and they are never ready at pickup time we always order a day before and have been let down time after time the staff at this location act like they are doing you a favor never again starbucks on hoover is our new location,negative
as i work in the mall  close to cocola  i sometimes would go in if there wasnt a line four out of the six or seven times ive order a sandwich grilled cheese or tomatobasilmozzarella  as im a lactovegetarian  animal flesh has somehow made it onto my plate and even in my sandwich um  if i wanted animal flesh  i would have ordered it  right  tonight was the last straw i went in  ordered a grilled cheese  expecting nothing but a grilled cheese and a scoop of their dry potato salad when the girl is finally done grilling it  she pops it in the togo box i checked it out and noticed something really off there was ham in my grilled cheese now  i know that they have a button for grilled cheese with ham  and the cashier didnt press that button she pressed the regular grilled cheese button so  i clarified that i didnt order the ham what does she do she says  okay  i can take the ham out if you want with a um  say what look on my face  i told her that im a vegetarian  id rather my grilled cheese not taste like ham so  she asked  what do you want me to do  make a new one i said  go for it  or you can just give me back my money she then proceeded  in complete confusion  to try to take the ham out and give me that sandwich so  i said  i am so sorry for being a difficult btch  but  please make me the sandwich i ordered  if you really must eat there  go earlier in the day the more competent staff seem to work before 3pm and  dont order anything but espresso drinks and pastries the food  service arent worth the money youll be spending,negative
just because oprah loves sprinkles doesnt mean they are the best cupcakes in the world really folks  oprah is not god  allah  jesus  the dalai lama  or your great grandmother  sure the cupcakes are semidecent but  the money and caloric intake of each cupcake is not worth it most people who are halfway decent in the kitchen can make cupcakes just as good if not better what makes homemade cupcakes different a ton of money is saved  along with the security of good nutrition when someone is in control of their own baking  they can control how much sugar and fat is used  but  please  go there if you love oprah and want to pay her bills  are not willing to bake your own cupcakes  spend 200 extra  and dont care that one cupcake equals an entire meal that probably will have much more protien and fiber in it,negative
service is slipping  i frequent this particular starbucks often and i was appalled when my family of 6 recently stopped in  apparently dropping 6 coffee orders on them was overwhelming these guys better not move to chicago or new york any time soon if they cant handle 6 coffees what really chaffed me was the fact that they got one of the orders wrong and my adult son courteously pointed out that his order was incorrect  the barista proceeded to instruct him on what he had ordered instead of owning up to the mistake  he took what she made him without making a scene but what happened to the customer is always right  ps  he orders the same thing every time so i know she messed it up,negative
i love a basic diner as much as the next girl  but this place is really bottomofthebarrel right near the fox  they cover the walls with playbills and posters and assume the decor will overshadow the fact that the food is overpriced and tasteless  ill admit it my friend and i had a few drinks at engine 11 before we hit broadway diner for a latenight dessert and soberingup session but usually  predrinking makes food taste better  not worse  they were out of the cake we wanted  but we eventually settled on an oreo cake i mean  how badly can you screw that up its chocolate  cream  and cake apparently  you can screw it up decently badly the dessert was stale  flavorless  and nearly inedible  with a moderately hefty price tag of 5 the service was okay while we were there  but when we left  our waitress was crouching outside the restaurant smoking a cigarette classy  all in all  not a place ill be going back to i tried not to judge a book by its cover but in this case  i should have im going to engine 11 next time,negative
it has recently come to my attention that there is an homage to lulus in fallout 3  which makes sense  as the postapocalypse is the only setting in which i could imagine myself enjoying their food  the food ranges from the barely mediocre chinese to a few perverse interpretations of panasian fare  for example  their pad thai  which is a soupy  syrupysweet  noodley mess  they even somehow manage to spoil the simple pleasure of bubble tea their tea is heavy  and seems to be creamed with coconut milk which seems like a good idea until youve had two sips and are full,negative
over priced  bad food and worse service  in fact the food was indistinguishable from bad chinese food,negative
i was never a particularly big fan of lulus  but after my most recent visit i dont really have any interest in returning my boyfriend and i ordered drinks waters  diet coke and then quite a while later  the waitress returned to take our food order without bringing drinks a good while passed during which no one even came to check on us so that we could remind them that we needed drinks  then our food arrived without drinks  i ordered a vegetable dish in which tofu is offered as a replacement for meat the dish arrived with about four small pieces of tofu the vegetables were bland and salty i left hungry  the prices arent bad  but it really shows in the quality its not one of those holeinthewall  wellkept secret type place there is a reason why the prices are cheap the food is not plentiful nor high quality  and the service is terrible the only thing really going for it is the bubble tea  im really laid back about waitresses being busy  but there were not many people in the restaurant and we didnt get our drinks until our meals were nearly finished,negative
i whish i could rate this place no stars 45 for 2 dishes and satay  carry out you got to be kidding me   small portions and the food was below average at best  long story short  i know thai and this aint it i think the location and the lack of anything like it in around keeps this place open cause i know the food cant be doing the trick for them  moved here from chicago and this falls way short of the worst thai place back home,negative
the staff is nice  but their product is consistently terrible and watery for whatever reason  the seating looks like a nice enough place to chill  but given the alternatives ive never been particularly driven to do so,negative
facts won is a chinese place that also serves some korean dishes   cons the main purpose of won is to feed the hungry in university city and fill them up it does just this do not expect food quality much above one of the chinese food trucks luckily  prices are about as moderate if you find yourself inside wons and wonder how you got there  then have the hot and spicy korean seafood soup  but please  only if you can eat spicy if you go for lunch  try to take the afternoon off food tends to be a little bit greasy  so you might not be able to move for a while  pros they have chinese fortune cookies with words of wisdom and lucky numbers,negative
i used to go here a lot in terms of italian  i think it has the best italian food in pittsburghprice  however  their is a new waiter there that is extremely pushy i used to get an appetizer to share with a friend and an entree  but the waiter would push dessert  when we refused  he would be curt he was so pushy for during every course  encouraging us to get the most expensive thing on the menu  even though we already decided on entrees he also was not present much  except to make us feel uncomfortable   i was unpleasantly surprised to discover that he is now a regular there he has consistently made my visits there so unbearable that i will never be returning,negative
got moussaka instead of bechamel  they put american cheese on topinteresting  cheap and not a tasty choice so much lamb on the menu  its hard to avoid just because it has lamb in it  doesnt mean its mediterranean friend had beef platter beef too dry  too well done for this price  you could get a lot better would not recommend,negative
this place is all about sake bombing and is usually frequented by college students many times underage who are looking to sake bomb and party last night  dynamite was blasting and there were people jumping around and singing at 1110 pm this is not a place where you can have a quiet and tasty japanese dinner the dishes are hit or miss  the rolls are quite small and they are a bit on the more expensive side the fish ive had has always been pretty fresh  so no complaints there  and the tempura is tasty but i know a lot of things are not good at all i only go here to drink because its like a really loud bar its a bit expensive and im pretty sure someone vomited under a table there yesterday it was extremely loud and obnoxious,negative
please dont waste your time here ive lived in univ city for a while and ive always contemplated going here to try the sushi or korean fare i once tried a bubble tea from it and although it took them years to make it and it was very overpriced  i liked it  i ordered a shrimp shumai dumpling to start the taste was really good  but it was served lukewarmthese either had been sitting around for a while or they were not reheated very well disappointment  next up  my friend ordered the hot stone bi bim bap and i ordered the veggie bi bim bap the appearance was nice  the egg was runny  but it just had absolutely no flavor nothing on the plate had flavor the kimchi on the side was fine  but neither the tofu nor the riceveggies had any flavor at all nothing had salt  everything just kind of tasted the same we added hot sauce but it just wasnt hot enough we asked for their real hot sauce and they said they had noneit was so disappointing we had originally wanted sushi but the sushi bar was closedwe went with these overpriced dishes we didnt even like or finish and walked out with a bad taste in our mouths  besides the fact that the food is not good  the ambiance can only be described as bizarre there was only one waiter for lunch on saturday and only 3 other guests it seemed like the restaurant lights were off for the most part in an effort to save energy  maybe  one other table was working in the back  and it just looked generally sketchy the service was not great and it was way too expensive for what we had  avoid this,negative
this place is bloody awful i went here one time my freshman year at uiuc and ordered their specialty basil chicken with fellow yelper dan t who reviewed this location as well the dish was pricey at 8 dollars a plate  but i was willing to give something different a try instead  when i received my order i got vegetables with ground up chicken bits that were about the size of the beef you would find in ground beef i was immensely disappointed so i went up to the front counter to ask for a refund as this is not the dish i expected it to be instead  in engrish  the manager said to me  you already pay no refund uhm  excuse me if i paid for something and was unsatisfied  shouldnt i receive a fair refund not for this place apparently avoid at all costs and go somewhere else,negative
this food was gross    we got a meatball sub cold  no sauce  salty  minimal meat  meatballs sliced in half that was dry and tasted bad as opposed to the preferable option of tasteless  the chicken ranchero was a mess of mushroom  no lettuce  tomato  ranch or bacon  and  it had sweet peppers on it  in short  it was the wrong sub  ordered online  so i dont know how they got the wrong order  yikes  do not order from here  this place makes subway look like a fivestar restaurant  go there instead  eat fresh   and  we just found out they sent us the wrong sub  instead of rectifying it  the manager hung up on us  stating they didnt have time to deal with it  probably because of all the other wrong orders,negative
this place is gross   first  i got a spicy tempura roll that was chicken instead of tuna  i mean  really chicken  second  the sushi was warm  third  the roll that was made to replace the chicken had an eyelash in the container and it wasnt mine  negative one star    sorry to be so harsh  but its better that you know,negative
wow  these guys are still open  i love cheesesteak sandwiches  and texadelphia has  without a doubt  the worst ive ever had  ive tried three locations  and theyre uniformly dreadful  the meat has little flavor  the bread is too soft and soggy  if you like cheesesteaks  keep going  nothin to see here  folks,negative
if i had read derrell ps review before going  i would have thoughtwell  thats an entertaining review  but could it really have been that bad surely there is some exaggerating going on   and even if it was true  that was back in 2008 the problems must be corrected by nowthey are still in businessif everyone had had bad food and been yelled at  surely the place wouldnt still be around three years later    if i could only go back in time to friday  may 13th and do it all again  trilussa la trattoria would forever remain an unfamiliar restaurant  and precious time and money would not have been wasted  instead  we must be here to let people know that three years later  derrell ps review is unfortunately still accurate    on the bright side  husband made it to the foodpoisoning free zone unscathed  although we held our breathe  also  there was no yelling involved in our otherwise derrell p experience so chef has  made miniscule progress      so  why did we even go to this holeinthewall restaurant on the eve of our 10th wedding anniversary  because we were staying at the carolina inn  it was within walking distance  and it came highly recommended by a friend who described it as their favorite restaurant  which is why we passed by vespa and 411  pushed open the dusty door and actually sat down at an uncomfortable table amidst the the tacky decor and despite the oppressive heat of the small dining room     it is also why we stayed at the uncomfortable table for way too long before seeing a serverand after finding out  the only winebytheglass options were a house red or a house whitetodays being a merlot or pinot grigio at 8 a glass but  i want a glass of chardonnay  is there no way to get one please  i dont care for pinot grigio and it feels too hot in here for merlot  waiter disappears for awhile and returns to make his first apology of the night to say no chardonnay by the glass  but i could take the rest of the bottle with me if i ordered a whole bottle  okay  fine  ill take a bottle of this one then  off he goes  only to return with a different bottle that i had never heard of  had no idea what it would cost or if i would like it  uncle  ill just have a glass of merlot  not playing this game  husband opts for unsweetened tea     by now  weve sitting for at least 20 minutes  husband looks like hes in need of sustenance quickly  so i suggest a caesar salad  especially cause they have an authentic one on the menu that lists anchovies as an ingredient  well  waiter says he doesnt think they have anchovies  but hell check disappears  apology 2  no anchovies   okay  fine well take it anyway before husband passes out     tea and a glass of warm merlot appears  its not boiling  but its  hotter than liquid should be without a teabag in it enough that i fish ice from my water glass  plop it in and try not to think about the 8 price tag     we were very hungry  which is why we tore into the average bread which turned out to be the best part of the meal  and even opened fake butter in a tiny round plastic container and spread it on the bread  its also why we remained sitting despite the caesar salad that arrived with  i kid you not  derrell p was not lyingsomething that resembled mozzarella on top it was mushy  white  tasteless   truly unforgivable  so were the tasteless croutons      oddly enough  i still remained hopeful for our entrees  as i had one coming that was supposed to be a rigatoni with chicken  italian sausage  prosciutto  fresh vegetables in a garlic wine tomato sauce  doesnt that sound great  husband was not only waiting for a tea refill  but was anticipating a capellini dish with shrimp and fresh vegetables in a tomato sauce    we waited and waited  finally our meals arrived  along with a crock of tasteless parmesan  positives i liked the fresh zucchini that was in the dish  the rigatoni was cooked fine  chicken wasnt horrible  despite looking like it had been massacred  what was inexcusable was the hideous mushy  disgusting meatballs that were in it  and the lack of italian sausage or prosciutto  husbands dish was way worse  the fishiesttasting   yet otherwise tasteless pile of mushy pasta with questionable haveiriskedmyhealth shrimp  husband  wanting out  ate it in disbelief that there wasnt even any garlic in it  with the hope we could get this over with and leave  i had to at least question the ingredients or lack of in my dish  waiter explained that the chef must have substituted meatballs for the sausage really but he would ask about the prosciutto      what resulted instead of yelling at us  so i do believe chef has made great progress  was a styrofoam  container of a ziti  prosciutto and onion dish that the chef prepared to prove that there was prosciutto in the kitchen  it was actually not bad  but didnt do us any good as we were staying in a hotel,negative
i only eat here is when im too hammered to walk to shattuck for a real pizza place  the first time i came  i thought i was getting an entire pizza for 4 but i only received 1 slice  making possibly the worst pizza deal ive ever heard of  if you need more than 1 slice to be full aka if you are a guy youll probably go broke one time after coming from kips i ordered 8 slices for myself and it was like 40 fortunately they accept credit cards since who carries around 40 in cash i recommend little caesars for a superior value also  pepes pizza now offers slices  if you eat your pizza at fat slice  you have to stand like livestock along this trough on the side wall i wish little caesars had a similar setup,negative
i went there for lunch on sunday with a friend i have not been there for a few months so i decided to try it again what a disappointment it was  the restaurant was 70 empty so we got a table very quickly ordering is quick and efficient simply by writing down quantities on a sheet of paper we ordered some salad  sushi and maki to start the seaweed salad was atrocious it was very greasy and the dressing on the lettuce at the bottom was diluted then came the sushi and maki the salmon slices on the sushi were extremely thin and the rice part is oversized even by removing half the rice  there was too much to eat comfortably in one bite also to note is that the fish was very soggy and generally did not taste fresh  a better choice for ayce sushi is the yes sushi in downtown kitchener not the yes on kingnorthfield next to sushi 99  the kitchener one is better if im in the area again for a quick bite  i would rather go to pho ben thanh next door,negative
i stopped in here one day for a bubble tea  i asked for the herbal bubble tea with no milk or sweetener  the cashier asked me are you sure  it will be really strong and i said yes  thats the way i drink it  she asked me again  are you sure  i said yes  she finally halfapproved of this and gave me my tea  450  i took one swig and the tea was rotten  i took it back up and told the cashier that it was rotten and she says oh  its probably really strong  i said no  i have had strong tea and rotten tea and this is rotten  she asked me again to be sure and then got the manager to give me a refund  he asked no question and gave me my money back  if you want good tea  go to dado  they will make anything you ask for without asking a million are you sure questions  and their tea is fresh,negative
one star for this place is way too generous  they only take cash  but dont post this in a conspicuous spot   i got stuck in harvard square one day and went in to greenhouse buy a cup of coffee and then asked if i may use their restroom  the waiter on staff looked at me like i was scum and actually shooed me away  flicking his hand like he was swatting a fly  what a meanie  i actually cried,negative
this place is not worth it  i think its the worst restaurant at lobdell  and there are all these indian buffets that are within 10 minutes walking  taste better  and cost an extra dollar    main offenses 1 the naan  the naan at cafe spice is more like a huge chunk of pizza crust  it is not naan    2  samosas suck  its hard to mess up samosas  since the deep fryer hides lots of imperfections but cafe spice does it 3  nothing here is good  im willing to forgive restaurants that might suck at a lot of things  but still make like two things well  ill just order those two things  nothing here is good    a plus side to its general crappniess is that theres rarely a long line,negative
if i were to review the middle east  my biased statements would suggest that the downstairs music venue is an unpleasant place to be  too many people for a small  hot place  not ventilated well enough  sound engineers are obsessed with bass which prevents me from hearing other instruments and lyrics to songs  i am a musician  and i enjoy all music  i saw budos band here a very interesting and eclectic group of musicians and could only hear bass and drums  despite there being about twelve other instruments on the stage  including various horns  i was wearing ear plugs which actually should have allowed me to hear more detail  but everything was unbalanced  i left early  and then i took a shower to wash other peoples sweat off of myself  this is not the middle easts fault  but can someone explain why small music venues seem to prompt people to dance wildly  waving arms and twirling  when there is literally no space for them to do so  im a hippie too  people  but i seem to have a greater awareness of the concept of personal space than some others,negative
this is the worst subway ive ever been to  its attached to a convenience store on the corner of beacon and mass ave  everytime i go in there the same guy is working  and he is the only guy i ever see  he isnt very nice and he always skimps on all the meat  cheese  and all the other toppings  he also doesnt offer any of the deals on different days that most subways do  skip it unless you are starving and cant find anywhere else,negative
oh my this place blows went in with a bunch of guys to celebrate a friends birthday last friday the atmosphere of the place is great  however  when it came time to order a drink  this is how the conversation went  me hey man can i get a long island ice tea bartender sorry man we cant make a long island me why not bartender we dont have a liquor license to mix more than 3 alcohols together me wtf  are you serious bartender yeah but heres a list of our cocktails  i have never heard of a bar not having a liquor license to mix more than 3 kinds of alcohol together i was flabbergasted and i didnt know how to respond i ended up ordering one of their disgusting cocktails it was just gin with water and lime for 11 do not go here,negative
the food was not tasty,negative
we didnt give this a chance why we went there because my wife wanted a big salad nothing on the menu looked appealing  ie like a salmon salad or crab salad it was all basic stuff  like beets  nothing complex  and the prices were around 10 bucks i looked at the entrees and noticed that sides  such as potatoes and vegetables  were for sale in other words  if i ordered an entree  there would be no complimentary side dishes as 95 percent of the restaurants in the world have the waitress was nice and the host greeted us at the door further  there was no one in the place hardly guess we werent the only one that felt it was outlandish they had better adjust that menu im sure that overhead is high  we got up and left and went to maxs opera cafe at stanford sc much better menu  a lot more for the money then again  that wouldnt be hard to do,negative
i have never been to pizza man  but i wish they would stop putting menus on the doorknobs in my neighborhood its both wasteful and poses a security risk theres been a wave of burglaries here  and these menus only help criminals determine which houses are unoccupied please stop,negative
unfortunately i brought a few friends here since i have had such amazing food and service in the past i am downgrading matsuri for the crappy service we received i had to get up twice  and my date had to get up once to get water  the check  attention  what have you as the servers entered and exited the dining room  the stare of death would not cause them to look in our direction as we stared at our empty water glasses and mess of plates after we finished dining  it might have been an hour before we finally were able to leave i am so bummed about this  you hate to proudly bring friends to a restaurant that can suck so bad the food was still good  but who can taste it when you are constantly trying to get your servers attnetion i was going to give 2 stars  but changed my mind because i was so embarrassed to bring friends here  i love matsuri not 5 stars because it is kind of casual however the sushi is amazing to me  and the service amazing  and just a great fun place to go lunch or dinner  i prefer to sit at the sushi bar and ask the chef to give me what hes got try the shiso hot it is spicy tuna served in a new way so good  the sashimi salad is great too  which i had with my best asian girlfiriend when we sat at a table so good the people are great  they beat a drum when you walk in  its just great fun and the people are wonderful  a great fun place to go  according to some  the sushi portions are small  but for me it is perfect you know i have a small stomach or something  closed on sunday  enjoy namaste tonya mtbchickcomtonyahtml,negative
if i were to score this place off of the food id give it at least 35 stars the shabu shabu was simple and came with all the veggies  udon  goodies  etc the meat seemed fresh very very thin the ponzu sauce was good  but a tad salty nothing compared to the ponzu from shabu shabu house  they had the typical minced daikon  garlic  and green onion sides  which i kinda abused hehe the ponzu and rice was unlimited yayyy  but the waitress kept giving us half bowls of rice instead of full ones i ended up eating 4 bowls i swear im not a fatass if i were to stop here  youd think that my experience here wasnt all that bad actually pretty good for a sit down food place in the good ol usc neighborhood but it was the service that really dragged the rating down we were initially the only people there  so we got pretty good and efficient service for the first 30 min or so once more people came  our waitress became much much slower and it seemed like the other waiters were just lounging around while she did most of the work what really pissed me off was when we went to pay for our meal it took her forever to bring the check and when my friend and i requested to split the bill exactly in half with our cards  she messed up and double charged us both then it took her at least 30 minutes to learn how to void the transaction during that time  we missed our ride home  i was almost late to my meeting  and we realized that we had to walk home in the cold no bueno for two tiny asian girls who arent used to the cold finally  they voided it but they werent sure whether itll go through so the manager gave us his phone number to call just in case it doesnt gee thanks  after we signed all the stuff  we headed out  very grumpy the waitress chased us down the street and told us that she made us sign the wrong receipts and accidentally charged some other tables credit card instead so then we repeated the whole process wow can i say incompetent  i understand that she may be new and all but seriously you dont mess up like that twice in a row not to mention  they werent really apologetic at all when it happened with that being said  i rather go to somewhere less convenient for shabu shabu rather than put myself through another one of these experiences,negative
i rather eat straight up white rice and soy sauce than eat here ive been here many a times  and each time continues to disappoint not only is the food bad  but the service is also atrocious the chicken bowl was awful and took close to 45 minutes to come out the people working there werent even apologetic and the entire time they were fooling around and being super slow also  after seeing the people in the back work without gloves and lick their fingers  then proceed to touch the food i have lost my appetite every time i remind myself how much i hate this place  but i only go for its damn convenience if you werent located directly under my apt  i would give you 0 stars but then again the time it takes for my food to come out is equivalent to the time it takes for me to walk somewhere better and get food thus  i give this place 05 stars for bad sushi  bad soup saw the server in the back try it and say that it tastes really weird and bad but then proceed to serve it  bad chicken bowl  bad potstickers tastes funky  bad everything  bad service  bad manaagement   and now im just ranting but thats just how bad it is,negative
 as an edit after receiving a rude reply from the owner  questioning whether or not i had buyers remorse after eating fried foods or whether or not i understand the difference between frying in canola oil and lardanimal fat ive decided to deduct a star or even 2 i wish i could give this 0 stars never in my life have i had a restaurant owner attack me for giving my honest opinion on the food i am offended and the response came off as super rude  original post i randomly get these tempura cravings and the one day that i decide to walk over to the other side of campus  i see the tempura truck sitting there  waiting for me to order from it super excited  i got the shrimp tempura hoping to get some nice  lightly battered  crispy  juicy pieces of shrimp  but no instead  this truck basically fried the living souls out of those poor shrimps the batter was so heavy  the fry so greasy  and the sauce was so typical overall i felt like an obese kid paving my way to cardiovascular disease while eating the tempura yah the shrimp was juicey as an edit  apparently the owner attacks this claim saying that if the shrimps were juicy  how were they overcooked well now let me explain  the shrimps were juicy  but the batter and fry around it was uneven and overcooked the edges were dark brown and tasted burnt  yah the portions were big  but noo i dont want to feel like my heart is about to stop every time i take a bite  way too oily  way too heavy  way too fried   ugh time to go work out now i feel gross  so there you go  tempura truck maybe its time for you to crack open some business books next time you decide to respond to an angry customer,negative
wow  this place really sucks its cheap but theres a reason why even with the free quesedilla w purchase offer when you check in  it wont bring me back here most dissatisfying meal ever  carne asada fajita burrito still has slimy beansnot much fajita going on meat tastes a month old gross  also  guy at drive through isnt so smart gave him 10xx for a 5xx bill he didnt give me my change had to ask for it shady or what trying to jip me 5   foods no good people arent friendly and obviously not smart just trying to steal my money with disgusting food and pretending to forget my change   i see how it is,negative
this place is overrated   the food is so so not as great as everyone says it is its literally a fat hot dog with typical ingredients piled on top its lacking sauce between the hot dog vs the sausage  the sausage is definitely better  tried the following   so calithis was the best item during my visit  the spring mix and aioli sauce  fried crunchy stuff added a nice flavor and crunch to the bite  holy aioli burgerit was soft normal burger  nothing special adding relish  onions from the condiment bar helped  abe froman sausage w onions and peppersno sauce dry dry dry   the chachion special that day on the blk chalkboard it came w pastrami and onionssoso  the food here is literally what it is ive had better hot dogs and sausages elsewhere costco sausage dog tastes just as good  if not better   also  the establishment is not groupon friendly  i came here with a friend we both had groupons the guy taking our separate orders gave us an attitude over it since he said it was one per table this place is pay at the counter and find a seat wherever type joint its not a sit in  order while youre at the table  and they bring your food type of place  so that rule shouldnt even apply plus  the groupon clearly states you can buy one as a gift i hate places that make up their own rules shady  not coming back not a good deal even with the groupon doesnt taste good enough for me to come back,negative
if you like slow service and retarded workers  come here  just came back from here  and i have to say that this was the worst experience i have ever had from wing stop  this location is horrible   it took them over 20 minutes to serve me my order to go what did i order  french fries  i really couldnt believe why it was taking so long to dish out a simple side order such as french fries  im gonna have to say that im officially going to protest this location  thumbs down wing stop on fig,negative
i second elaine ts review  i went here a few weeks ago and drove around the plaza for 10 minutes  finally concluding that they must have closed down  what a disappointment,negative
i want to make it really really clear  i am not looking for sit down  napkin on the lap service i know what heroes is  i go to the one in fullerton all the time and it was a meeting place for old friends  when you have 2 guys come in during the day time on an empty day and cant even get a menu or order a beer from an empty bar with two bartenders thats badon a friday night where the bartender blows off your order and pours himself a beer and gives you the cold shoulder  or when you sit down after waiting forever and the waitress stands you up and says these people have a bigger group after they just walked inyeah that is insulting   i know what a cheers getdrunk and eat place is in fact i was at cheers in boston where i got drunk and atethe fullerton heroes is always packed at night and yet they always manage to get you a table and beer quickly why is it that an empty place cant even place a beer order at a bar with two bartenders  ok you want a simple breakdown  ill give you a simple breakdown and then ill throw suggestions in there    peanuts go on ground yay big portions of mediocre food beer variety through dirty hoses servicethat will get to you eventually the letter h in the beginning of the name  yes you get to eat peanuts and then throw them on the ground yay that is really entertaining for the first 5 minutes unfortunately to get to that point where you can enjoy eating peanuts and throwing shells on the ground you need to be seated and offered said peanuts that may take you 15 minutes when the place is emptygod help you if its full  which baffles me how it can be  yes they have burgers yes they are huge omg so many frikin fries but that meal took so long that by the time they killed the cow and ground up the meat  got done with their side conversation about shoes or whatever  updated the facebook status  talked about their weekend  had a beer break  etc hence the reason why it took them over 12 an hour to make a burger  there also must be a maze between the bar and the kitchen because those poor girls get lost so by the time it gets to you  youre so hungry that burger is gonna taste awesome dont be fooled  their burgers are mediocre at best  if you are a starving student or a teenager and you are comparing mcdonalds  jack in the box  carls or heroes  well then yes heroes has the better burger congrats you beat the dollar menui will say it  heroes burgers taste better than mass produced meat cleaned with ammonia to prevent e coli outbreakshey do you know who else has big burgers the press and the back abbeyand their burgers a delicious actually i order something new each time i visit those places and i havent had a bad thing yet  yes they have beer yes they have microbrew like stone arrogant bastard  yay gargoyle  middle finger  hops and an oak barrel  do you know who else has varieties of beer every other place on that strip do they have as many probably not  but seriously  what do most people drink blue moon arrogant bastard a  chimay to feel fancy the press has a good beer selection if youre like me and you love beer  the back abbey has so many trappist beers on tap that you wouldnt know what to dobe warned though  both the back abbey and the press get packed  but just wait a minute or two and the bartender will get to you  they will get you a beer  they will make time for you ask yourself this question what is the point of going to a beer place if i cant get a beer  and if i do get a beer its served through dirty hoses that throw off the beer flavor for you youngins who just turned 21 and trying to get your drink onif you dont like beer and just like to pee a lot and get tipsy  drink corona or the lightlite beers if you likelove beer then dont drink tainted beer if you dont have to  yes they have service crappy crappy is a type of service just like telling a personal trainer that round is a shape  i want to give you my money  i want to tip you wellwhy do you prevent me from doing this so willingly pay in cash  rumor has it that if you pay by card you might find that they tip themselves generously   i am of the mindset if i see dog crap on the ground  i see you walk to it and i dont warn you  then its on me for not warning you and you messing up your shoes with dog crap here  this is me saying there is nasty on the ground  dont step in it   please please please visit the back abbey  the press  viva madrid  any place but heroes  legendsdo yourself a favor visit heroes in fullerton they have great beer selection  great service  clean keg hoses  good food  quick service and great atmosphere,negative
if you really enjoy faux irish pubs staffed with rude bartenders and annoying clientele that look like your uncle put up tons of bs euro schwag in his garage to attract 21 year olds then welcome home  the beer pong tables are warm  the roofiecoladas ready and plenty of screeching trixies to make any popped collar male salivate  i love asking what do you have on tap and being met with everything you see here  dont work too hard  you might herniate a disk    if youre over 23 and have self respect you shouldnt be drinking here,negative
so a few friends of and i wanted to hit a spot that had a huge portion of nachos that served beer we ended up at heroes i havent been to heroes in a couple of years and the last time i was here i remember the food and alcohol selection to be good  not to mention good for groups i was wrong   the place is designed to look like a sports bar and they hand you free packages of peanuts when youre done husking a peanut you can just toss the spent shell on the ground all the sports games are beamed from their tvs against the bar wall  the service was mediocre at best we waited a long time to put our orders in  waited a long time for our drinks  and waited even longer for our bill   the food if you can call it that was probably the worst ive had in a few months  anywhere the nachos were the only saving grace and they werent even that tasty stick with the half order  do not get the full order i ordered a chicken sandwich with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes i couldnt even get halfway through my sandwich before i had to put it down the fries were so salty to the point of being almost inedible i dont even want to get into what happened the next morning after eating here my friends ordered a french dip and a buffalo burger both of them were very disappointed with their meal   i dont know what happened to this place a few years ago the food was pretty good and the service was great   for the same price and a wider selection of beers  i strongly recommend other places to eatdrink such as the back abbey or eureka burger,negative
probably the worst sushi experience ive ever had but then again  you cant expect much when going to an allyoucaneat restaurant in kw   everything is prepared really fast with little regard to presentation or quality the spicy salmon turned out to be salmon rolls with hot sauce drizzled on top  the cooked food section is ok  the tempura is acceptable at least you get allyoucaneat ice cream you cant go wrong with ice cream  im always amazed by the enthusiastic responses i get towards yes i guess people here dont know good sushi,negative
beware  the parking lot for this business now has a person on the lot hiding in a car who boots your car as soon as you leave the property  even if you are only going off the property for 2 minutes after having lunch  i have gone to this business for years but will not ever again  this deceptive practice and holding you up for 75 is terrible,negative
i am so disappointed to find out that they had changed hands to einstein bros bagels  a few weeks back i thought they are going through a remodeling as the noahs bagels sign and trimmings were removed inside the store  today when i went there the sign had changed to an ugly yellow and black logo  my first impression was  what an unappealing logo  remodeling was completely done inside the store  however  they no longer offer the same choices of bagels  the peppercorn potato bagels have changed to potato bagels  no peppercorn  cranberry orange bagels which they used to have during thanksgiving and christmas seasons have no orange  just cranberry bagels  i then ordered my favorite usual which was good grain bagels  when i went to check out  i found that not only did they change management  they also raised the price  half a dozen costs 529  however  the worst thing was that when i was about the enjoy my good grain bagel  it was hard as stone  i even had a hard time to tear it apart  also  the good grain bagel has a sweetness to its taste  i had the first bite and then the 2nd  the bagel was too hard to devour  i then brought all the bagels back to the cashier and asked them if the bagel was from yesterday  all the cashiers know me because i have been buying bagels from them throughout the week  always half a dozen  always good grain  peppercorn potato and blueberries  i told them that the bagels did not taste fresh as it was hard as stone  i told them i know what a fresh bagel is different from a dayold bagel as i bought them throughout the week  the staff said it just came out about an hour ago and they always gave away bagels that was unsold by the end of the day  i told them to try it out as the bagel was too hard to devour  also  i asked them why the bagel tastes sweet now  they said they had added corn crumbs and honey wheat to the bagels i am totally disappointed with the new recipe  luckily  the cashier was willing to give me a full refund  i dont know anything about einstein bros bagels but this new management sucks  it is such a big disappointment that my favorite bagels are all gone and recipes changed  i would rather go to panera even though their bagels are more expensive  at least they would not serve me hardasstone bagels,negative
because im from la  i thought pho might be a safe choice for having asian food here at austin it turned out i was wrong i didnt try other dishes here  but their pho was absolutely the worst that i have ever had the soup was so salty  the beef was also scarce  the rice noodle was just overbroiled,negative
the only reason for me to step in was its only several blocks away from my school their pho 1 is mediocre with only a few pieces of meat rare beef was okay  welldone beef was like plastic meat ball was like rubber ball chopped into three pieces even in pasadena  its been overpriced 10 for a mediumsized pho come on  this is sgv you can easily find much better pho with much more meat under 6 or 7 id rather drive to alhambra or san gabriel next time,negative
very expensive  taste is not that good  we were really disappointed moreover serving size is small  not many veg options i surely will not go here again,negative
poor service  worse coffee  we ordered 2 cappuccinos they were made with preground espresso taken out of an unsealed plastic bin   the proportions were way off and i could not even finish it  they claim to to roast their own beans which makes me wonder why they dont put the effort into preparing the coffee properly  there is no excuse for serving espresso made with preground beans  if you dont want to buy a decent grinder for espresso just dont serve it  i didnt have the drip coffee but i witnessed the cashier pouring two old pots together,negative
overpriced cupcakes and long lines the quality is ok but nothing so extraordinary to stand in line for half an hour i wish they would put  less frosting on them   it really overpowers the taste of the cake used,negative
blech the dark chocolate frosting was way too sugary  and the cake was dry and crumbly and lacked much in the way of chocolate flavor also  you have to order at the counter and wait to be called wtf  even if all youre having is a cupcake on a plate they even waste an order slip on single items their cupcakes cost 350 tax not included  so i paid more than karas would have cost me for an inferior product  the counter people seemed very friendly  but the cupcake was lackluster enough that i wont be back,negative
if i remember correctly  the way you make kirks fries is as following  1 open your bag of frozen fries 2 dunk them in oil 3 serve  im waiting for my heart attack  note theyre not all too welcoming towards high schoolers anymore,negative
straight off  know this when you see my rating  hair in my crossaint  how nasty is that maybe theyre trying to show its actually handmade i stared at the hair and said  okay  im not eating another bite  their buffarello mozzerella salads are good and hairless but it does seem a little pricey 7 when compared to the regular salads 5 the paninis are not very filling  though  heres a tip as if you can switch your tart what is that one that looks like a brain with one of the mini chocolate squares to the left of the register now  those are goooood,negative
i probably had one of my worst restaurant experience here  i just graduated from college so a couple of my friends and i went there to have dinner some of my friends wanted to order a beer and they ended up showing up him their passport since all of us were international students it was obviously an international passport he looked at it and was like pennsylvania law states that it has to be an us issued id basically non americans are not allowed to drink in pennsylvania although they have identification clearly proving that they are over 21  since this was now a matter of principle  i pulled out my windows phone 7  went to the pennsylvania state law website and proved it to him that international passports were indeed valid acceptable ids   we would have walked out if it werent for the fact that we had already ordered our food and places and it was getting late he was rude to us for the rest of the night and it was a pretty bad experience for the seven of us who went there to celebrate graduating  never ever going back there,negative
having moved back to nyc from california  i definitely miss the huge  megachain supermarkets and their selections and prices  unfortunately for me  morton williams is the closest market to my building  unfortunately because   the prices are beyond ridiculous for both fresh fruitveggies and nonperishables  the prices are comparable to whole foods though theyre not organic  if not more for certain items 189 for a can of evaporated milk is nuts  the majority of the cashiers are miserable  i didnt think it was possible to express so much misery in a 2 minute 99 nonverbal transaction  its like each customer they ring up is their mortal enemy  and they get ruder by the hour the ones who work at 3am are way worse than those working at 3pm  they have an okay selection of things  but not everything that you might need their over the counter medicine  health and beauty products are confined to a tiny section  and of course  are like 15 times what youd pay at duane reade  there are only 2 positives   its 24 hours  its clean  well lit and ventilated nice that they blast the ac during hot days,negative
looking at the menu  i was tempted to try a salad rather than pizza but my friend recommended i try their pizza because they believed it was good   i had the margarita and was very disappointed  the crust was burnt and the sauce was thin and runny it did not have much cheese if i were to return to this restaurant i would surely not go for the pizza expensive for the unsatisfactory quality and size,negative
only good if you are really drunk trust me  i know from experience,negative
update after four separate dinner occasions at luna  i will not go back  ive had horrendous customer service each time and the food was just okay  a friend and i came here for a nice dinner on a saturday night  they werent busy at all  we planned to order a bottle of wine and asked the server who clearly had no service experience what she recommended after waiting a good 1015 minutes for a wine menu  she saidand i quotei dont know  im not really a wine drinker  im more of a beer drinker and walked away  seriously  this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant and you cant even recommend something  anything  this was absolutely ridiculous  whatever  it gets better  we finally order a bottle at random and she comes back with it about 15 minutes later again  theyre not busy at all  she gets to our table with it  clearly tries to remember what shes been told to do presentationwise  and then saysohi dont know how to open this  and goes to get another server  then sits our white wine on the table  we request a bucket to keep it cool  which should be a given  and she looks clearly annoyedconfused  anyway  we both ordered the risotto  which was decent  but not fantastic at all  i think our bill was 8090 for two  which is fine if the food and experience are great  but in this case  i felt like i totally got ripped off  i have a couple of other fantastic customer service stories about previous experiences here  so its clear to me that they cant quite get it together  luna  go to bacaro and take notes,negative
tried the newest pizza joint in latham last night had big expectations given the decor and the unique combinations offered on the menu heres the rundown  extralarge meatlovers pizza  a ton of meat  not a lot of flavor small pepperoni pizza  not much better than a frozen pizza 10 bbq wings  tender  juicy and good flavor didnt come with bleu cheese dressing or carrotscelery 1 star large eggplant parm sub  a lot of eggplant and not a lot of cheese or sauce small antipasto salad  fresh veggies  green leaf lettuce  meat and provolone rollups no extras marinated peppersartichokesolives and no dressing 2 stars  so not a redo for me luckily there are 9 other pizza places within a 1 mile radius to choose from good luck crispy basil,negative
i never see soap in their bathrooms so  im not sure how the staff are washing their handsenough said   oh yea that staff is nice and the service is good its always crowded seat wise but yeamethinks not,negative
i work around the corner and have had take out lunch here several times  the food is always mediocre at bestbut the last time i ordered there was a hair in the dough of my steamed dumpling  so gross  im not going back,negative
if it were not for brown and their students insatiable appetite for margaritas and lousy mexican food this place would have shut its doors years ago stay away,negative
rynos is on telegraph  close to channing its not very good the yogurt was melting fast and their strawberries were rotting sighi guess the decor was ok given i went in 2008 maybe its gotten better,negative
this pinkberry deserves 0 stars for our recent encounter  dont get me wrong  pinkberry is good stuff  but this location is beyond pathetic  sorry employees  but you guys really need to get it together  we ordered a smoothie  it was completely empty in the joint and they acted like they had never made a smoothie before  first of all  we had to wait 5 or so minutes for another employee to run to the back and get milk because they had none  while waiting  the employee was asking us questions like  would you like milk or ice mixed into your smoothie  what  our answer put whatever you normally do to make a smoothie  thanks  so the employee nervously fills a dinky 12 oz smoothie cup with oodles of strawberries  almonds and chocolate our choice of ingredients for the smoothie and then finally the milk arrivesthe guy anxiously opens the milk on its way down to the table and blends the strawberries  chocolate and almonds and milk in a blender  were thinking  ok then he asks us  is this thick enough for you   mind you  why ask the question  it looked like diluted pepto bismol   we say  arent you going to add some yogurt   my husband looks to me and says  are we not in a freakin yogurt shop  haha    then the guy quickly adds a teeny bit of yogurt blends it for 2 seconds and keeps his head down and serves it to us  come on  start over dude  we had a bad feeling from the start that the disorganization and cluelessness of the workers took all confidence that this smoothie would have anything on a red mango smoothie  not to our surprise  the pinkberry smoothie was horrendous and we dumped it after a few sips  we ended up going out of our way to jamba juice    if we werent late for our event  we would have complained  it was comical to say the leastwe would have demanded a refund 450 worth of nasty frothy pink milk  wheres the yogurt 1 tiny squirt of yogurt isnt going to change the texture of this thing or whatever it waspathetic guys,negative
sushi rock does not rock i went for dinner and lunch and both times  it was overpriced for the portion and the quality i love salmon so i got their sunrise roll and their salmon avocado roll i barely finished half of what i ordered because it was just unappetizing their salmon was sort of tasteless and i was really looking for that salmony flavor   isnt anyone else outraged that they charge 099 for miso soup when i went to sushi places this summer soup and salad were usually given for free actually  i cant recall a sushi place that ever charged for miso soup   one star for their cheeseballs,negative
i live off of liberty ave and everyone kept telling me i needed to try this place  so after 4 months i did  when my wife and i walked in i thought  this place doesnt look too bad  actually kinda cool  wrong  after being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table  our food took about 45 minutes  which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast  but i though  everyone thinks this place is great  i guess i can wait for perfection   the food gets to our table  it looks good  it looks like breakfast  but it is cold  well mine was cold  so im sitting at the table  empty coffee  cold breakfast and quite pissed off  because of the situation and im hungry  finally after about 1012 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is  i tell her my food is cold  and im fine and dont need another plate  we had already been there over an hour  we had placed to go  ya know  when the waitress brings the bill over she doesnt just tell me she took my food off  she says  i figured i would take the food off even though you didnt ask really  should i have to  wifes food was hot  but she thought it to be just average breakfast  i never want to go back  but i will  because i always give places another shot  terribly slow service server was very nice though  probably home from college  and food took forever  i doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis  because this place wouldnt be so packed and highly regarded,negative
ok maybe  just maybe the kitchen staff at royal bengal was having an offday  the day i decided to go we wanted to have a goodbye dinner for our friend who was leaving to go visit home in bombay and someone in our party recommended this restaurant im not exactly sure what some of the other people ordered  but two of my girl friends and i decided to split the lamb masala and the aloo gobhi the lamb masala was decent  but something was just wrong with the aloo gobhi at first  i thought it was just me and that i didnt know the difference between good and bad indian food but everyone else at the table tasted it out of our party of nine  seven were born and raised in india  and dubbed it inedible we ended up sending two dishes back to the kitchen because they were just plain nasty the only positive thing about that night was the yogurt lassi that helped me wash everything else down,negative
still sucks i want my stars back,negative
so i came into this place a couple weeks ago because some friends wanted to grab breakfast on a sunday i must say i was completely blown away i loved the 50s diner feel and the friendlybut thats about it the staff was really busy so i didnt mind the wait so much and i arrived before my party of four so i expected to wait a hot minute when the rest of my party arrived however we waited and waitedand waited after finally getting our orders taken we played the waiting game again i didnt mind waiting so much as that our drinks were never refilled the waitress pretty much ignored our table until our food was just about to come out by this time i was starving so seeing the food on the tucked way food bar in the back i became elated untilthe waitress cleaning the bar off with a bar towel proceeds to use the same bar towel to wipe of my plate i guess it was still wet from washing and set the food on the plate i immediately told the waitress my friends and i were leaving and why she repliesoh needless to say i will never come back or recommend this place,negative
probably by far the worst place ive ever eaten this year or make it the past 3 years the ramen so boring the meal was so entertainingly boring  i found myself taking out my iphone and rechecking my facebook over 40 times  even though i knew for certain there were no new notifications i also had to continuously squirt inappropriately copious amounts of teriyaki and sesame sauce into the bowl on several repeated attempts to liven it up i also tried on several attempts to enjoy some of the wall decorations inside the restaurant which i later on decided that the faded photo of the gyoza on the right side of their menu was the most exciting thing to gaze at between taking forced bites of my ramen i did gaze up at the ceiling a few times and saw that red round thing actually  i just remembered  the most exciting part of the meal occurred as one worker went around to each window and raised the sun blinds up  so that more light could stream into the restaurant that was neat i thought to myself  how could anyone back there in the kitchen not be ashamed of what is coming out do they even know do they   but man i got to give it up to the guy working the counter  5 stars for him such a happy guy i dont know how he does it i dont know   bless your blessed souls you brave usc trojans who are forced to eat here by proximity  by the way  i ate the entire bowl even drank all the broth down to the last drop thats how you do it immedately walked out the door throwing up 2 peace signs toward the sky,negative
very unfriendly restaurant  went in and refused to seat us because i had a baby with me  wtf when asked why they said because they served hot tea  whateversakura express has  way better sushi than your little sewer hole,negative
im not sure if this place deserves one stari went with my husband tonight to get some dinner  we ordered two specialty rolls  chirashi  and tamago sushi  the rolls were tasteless  the fish was tasteless tuna was especially fishy in a bad way  and the portion sizes were very small the tamago was not what we expected at all  for the amount of money we spenti couldve gotten much better at sakura express definitely not worthy of a return visit,negative
i have not been impressed with this place even though i tried to give them a few chances  i dined in the restaurant once and the place was so cramped that the next table was only a few inches from mine  i could hear the conversation of the people that were two tables away  their menu said that my combo came with a salad but they never brought one to me claiming their menu was misprinted  i felt since they advertised it they should of comped the salad or mentioned it before i ordered  the second time we went there i ordered an adana wrap to go and it was so small for something that was 8  there one tiny piece of meat in the wrap  the third time i ordered delivery from there and and they overcharged me by more than five dollars  i didnt realize because i did not have the menu with the prices until i looked at the one stapled to our food  i was not happy about that,negative
blakes is full of ampted 1924 yearold berkeley students getting tanked in order to prep for banging one of the many slutty rotten eggs that hang there luckily  some ok bands are seen into the basement from time to time but as the night progresses  the slime from the main floor and upstairs inevitably oozes not only into the basement but out onto telegraph ave here  overtestosteroned boys cranky from not scoring poon start fights with eachother  barf  and eventually drive home drunk awesome,negative
cheap cheap cheap with the toppings ive been here once  right when it opened they barely filled the cup with yogurt  and the middle was hollow thanks for the single teaspoon sprinkling of granola  and carefully laid out strawberries wtf,negative
hohoho  its almost indulgently fun to write reviews about restaurants like this  almost as fun as spotting the typos on the menu  nothing was good about this place  not one thing  i got the spicy beef  with a side of brown rice that evidently i have to pay extra for  thanks for letting me know after the fact  as i could have predicted  the bowl was 70 onion and pepper  and the beef was like paper  no seriously  havent you ever tried to eat a tiny piece of paper  thats what the beef was like  chewy and flavorless  not to mention indigestible  the omnipotent clovebasil flavor was overwhelming  and the only source of spiciness was the serrano peppers  i could have just brought my own serranos  what a cheap way to create heat  however  it certainly wasnt cheap economically  considering i had to add a gratuity tip because i was with a large group of people  nothing irks me more than being forced to tip services that do an abysmal job    lastly  a random thought  on one wall they have a certificate hanging up that thanks berkeley thai house for a donation to the child abuse foundation  um  shouldnt that organization be called the antichild abuse foundation  yikes,negative
multidimensional failure  i wish i could review the actual cupcakes but am instead forced to review why i couldnt have there cupcakes  it was after the super bowl and i wanted to surpise my girlfriend with a cupcake as she was studying for a final the next day someone at the watching party mentioned giving trophy a shot as i was thinking of just heading over to cupcake royale as i was already in capitol hill i whip out my phone and hop on there website to check how late they are open on sundays and the site clearly states 9pm so i figure i am good to go  upon arriving at the university village i cant find the place and it is getting close to 9pm  i double check the website on my phone for a hint of what part of the massive complex they are located but have no luck eventually i google trophy cupcake university village and find a couple articles about the opening of the store which mentioned something about a frog fountain and a play ground which at least gives me something to look for i park and go check a map and i see fountain icons and what i can only figure is a playground icon on the map so i walk in that direction only to find a pitch black store  so not only did their website lie to me you cant even see the store from the road so im not sure how the hell they expect you to find it  upon getting home and checking the yelp page i see that yelp has them closing at 6pm on sundays and when i go to there website using my own computer it also says 6pm now i think i am going to crazy so i double check with my phone and it still says 9pm  flash is evil for the love of god stop using flash  on my phone when i click on locations i am directed to the following page which only loads the text and not the flash on my cell phone httpwwwtrophycupcakescominfohtm  if you view source on that page youll see where it says 9pm is the close on sundays which is exactly what i saw i wouldnt have cared if they closed at 6pm on sunday if there webpage had just told me that and i hadnt wasted my time trying to hunt the place down,negative
first  they dont take reservations so we get there at 545pm  and there is a 2 hr wait  and the 2 very small bars that they  do have are full but it is first come first serve so we take our chance at the bar   we order a drink and strategically stand behind a couple that were finishing their dinner at the bar  while they were finishing another couple had just walked into the bar area and were obviously big money and went straight to the bartenders to talk to them  the couple standing in front of us were about to leave and looked right at us and offered us their seats  we sit down  and the bartender walks over to us and tells us sorry  but these seats have been promised to this couple  the one that had just walked in   so you dont take reservations  but you promise bar seats to people   we could not believe it and decided to walk right out thank goodness hemenways  is right down the street because it had a much better bar area and was not filled with stuck up people as in al fornos,negative
take it for what it is  i suppose  cuatros has a big patio  its great for groups  you can watch all the soccer you want there  the food is terrible  and i am consistently disappointed with the service  last time i went  we waited two seconds to get our table  and about an hour and fifteen minutes for the waitress to take our order  i understand that we were a big group  but if you want to provide service to big groups  hire a bigger wait staff  service that slow really takes away from the dining experience  its hard to enjoy your food when youre angry about the slow service    what upsets me most is the included gratuity  if youre going to hire an insufficient wait staff for your giant restaurant  its really unfair to demand a tip like that  we were a large group  and our check was not split up i think waiters and waitresses who cantdont do this are dumb and lazy  evidently we shorted the waitress about 12 on a few hundred dollar tab  which always seems to happen even if everyone swears that they paid in full  she came out and told us that we shorted her  take the hit  you were a terrible waitress  you dont deserve a tip that high  so when we accidentally come up short  have some pride and class  and go home with 12 dollars less that night  instead of whining to the table about it  at least one of their waitresses is a whiny baby who is in over her head in the restaurant business  i always groan when people want to go to dinner here with a group  next time  i wont be ordering food  you brought it on yourself  cuatros,negative
this place is overpriced for subpar food  the waitstaff is too stoned to take less than a half hour on any order  people rave about the queso here  but i dont know why  its too thick and salty  and the chips dont help  i havent had pancakes here  and i hear theyre worth the trip  but nothing gets me excited to eat here  i say can it and find a taco stand on the street,negative
bunch of buttholes who work hereincluding the manager who probably isnt even certified to manage anything  basically  a couple months ago i ordered a pizza via phone  employee tells me that service is backed up and that i would have to wait at least an hourokay fine with me except i never received my pizza after an hour and 15 minutes of patiently waiting  i call back and the employee informs me that they have no record whatsoever of my order i demand to speak to manager  and all she does apologizes rudely might i add and hangs up and thats it not even an offer to makeup  etc will never  ever order here again,negative
this place is dirty  just  bleh  out of all the places on the drag  this place is one of the nastiest  i dont know why all my friends like going to this place  i tried the pad thai yeah  yeah  i know  stereotypical customer getting pad thai  but it was nasty  i feel like i would be able to make better pad thai on my own and im a terrible  terrible cook  and then the customer service  ack  that was terrible  i understand that they can get busy and all but this was just down right terrible  if i return to madam mams it will not be my choice,negative
yeah madam mams is in close vicinity to college students attending ut  yeah its thai food on the drag yeahhhthats about it for me  walking inside  the place smells horrendous  like bathrooms no joke and looks unclean  prices are high and portions are tiny  the food itself is not pleasing at allvery americanized and not fresh  the pad thai had sauce that lookedtasted like ketchup  the mangosticky rice dessert is sour  the consistency of the rice was just not right  and there was barely any coconut milk on it  i have ate there numerous times unfortunatelyi had no choice due to friends pick  and i swear i had tummy aches after each visit for the rest of the day    if you want thai food  go down the drag to thai kitchen,negative
well  what can i say about food at this place   plain  small  expensive just like all the chinese food in the area  this place is no exception the food i got here was exactly what i kinda expected from places this close to campus  maybe im bitching because ive been spoiled in houston  where you can still get a giant plate of lunch special in chinatown for 4 bucks  or have two giant meals with enough leftovers for four more for 305 tip oh well  these college kids seems to be content with this but to me the standards are set long ago and in a land far far 160 miles away   the chinese food here just doesnt hold up maybe one day some dashing young houstonian with a kind heart and an entrepreneur sense will liberate your schooltormented souls with cheap and delicious food and not be tempted to overcharge your butt for profit until that day  keep shelling out 8 or more for a plate and think youre getting a great deal here id rather save my chinese appetite and my money for gas to houston better quality  quantity  and pricing,negative
hello can you bus the tables hello we came to double daves on a saturday night  one other couple just finished up and was leaving we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 1520 minutes waiting on some out of town family to arrive most of the tables were filled with leftover food and dirty dishes it was gross the restaurant was not busy at all  so its not as if the staff was overwhelmed or anything we had to find a table off in a darkened corner because of this blech  sadly  we did eat there  though not very much because we had lost our appetites and the food is not that great   and when we left absolutely none of the tables had been cleared another family that was arriving was in the same boat they sat right next to us because there was no where else to sit wth really  what reason do i have to return,negative
this is not chinese food  a friend and i came here one time  honestly  because we heard it was bad and we wanted to see for ourselves just how bad bad was  boy ill tell ya  bad is about as bad as it gets the foodisjust plain wrong  like above  it is not chinese food  and why anyone would call it chinese food is completely beyond me  not to mention  i had to pay ten dollars for a plate ofdisgustingness  angry does not even describe how i was feeling  i almost didnt pay for my meal and i certainly did not tip  because that was just a completely waste of my time and money,negative
went back for lunch again was in the area again for work and was asked if we were there for breakfast or lunch  being that it was 1100 am i said wed take both menus and take a look    by the time we were all ready to order off the breakfast menu we had to wait a bit for another diner to meet us  our waitress told us that we were no longer allowed to order off the breakfast menu  when i told her we were given a menu and a choice when we walked in  she said that was then  well now    so on two seperate occasions ive tried to order breakfast  and twice ive been denied  no leniency either time  and whats worse  this timeno apology  not even a  sorry about that or even let me see  nothing  the worst waitress experience ive ever had  i even conciously noticed if she ever said please or thank you and the only time she said thank you  was when i handed her back the visa machine  thinking back  i should have not tipped  grrrrr  so now  i happily take back my 3 stars and begrudgingly give 1 star,negative
i dont understand how this place rates so highly food is horrible and reminiscent of frozen food you get at the grocery store,negative
went there for an important business lunch  4 words cockroach in my lemonade  and i drank some of it already before i saw it in there  note that for the rest of our lunch  my lunch partner and i had to examine every bite of salad to make sure there were no bugs in it  not enjoyable  the server was very apologetic  which was nice  their exuse was we just fumigated and it mustve gotten into the hose that feeds the lemonade  gross  i was trying to get over the horror of a cockroach in my lemonade  but every time i would tell a friend and try to laugh about it  my friends were terrified  so  i wrote a letter to the manager a few weeks after the event and never heard back  isnt this like a super bad health hazard  note to management thad  that is you address your clients letters  i took the time to express my dismay  even if its with a written response and nothing more  do something  a written apology wouldve been nice,negative
i love chinese food but just not this one i agree  this should be given two  not one i have never in my life not not taken home my left over chinese food until i ate here the meats were hard  dry  veggies old i tried to like it because i like almost everything  but no bueno my kids were pretty ticked off at me for choosing this place because they hated even their favorite foods here they love family thai  fong noodlemmm we ate here before i discovered yelp  so sorry about the delayhahaha,negative
we went here on a monday night as new delhi was closed  we would have been better off picking another cuisine instead of substituting with tandoor india  the staff were so dour that they would have been better suited for working for a funeral home than a restaurant  all the food was mediocre at best and the selection on the buffet was very small compared to nd  we finished our pitcher of water and were not provided a refill  the rice in the rice pudding was overcooked and i got very bloated after eating here  a reaction i have never had in the past to eating anything  my fiance had the same outcome,negative
rude that is the best description of the service trying to run a overdressed pizzeria like you are the line cook in some 50s retro diner is not effective also it would help to actually pay attention to what the customer is ordering i was overcharged and then barked at to retrieve my order from the other counter on my own  only to look at my food and find the one item that i had made a change to wanted it left out wasnt even done save your money and go somewhere else,negative
mixed menu with multi national cuisine usually not a good idea the sushi tasted frozen and the sushi rice was kind of crunchy  but not in a good way the sashimi was flavor less the waitress was attentive but not all there we ordered a bottle of sparkling water and she only brought us one glass with it the meal came with small corn bread muffins as the bread supplement which were decent the spicy tuna roll was goodif i wouldve bought it from morton williams i mean   all in all it wasnt a horrible experience or anything but compared to other places in the area it was bottom of the barrel maybe it was just an off night,negative
while a student at uwtrying out the restaurants was fun except this place  service is horrible  the food is not even good  and another restaurant that likes to demand a tip and has the nerve to make the waitress check the table for a tip i tend to not tip especially when they made us wait 15 min for a menu and the food was served cold  edit i wrote this review last year  for my experience that i had five years agoand i tend to not go back to places where ive had a bad experience im sure things change over the years  and who knows it may even be way betternew owners  new servers  new cookwho knows    i only wrote this because i thought that thats what yelp is for  to share your experiences,negative
this place doesnt even deserve any stars at allmy first two times were fine and i enjoyed it  but then i realized ehh the food isnt that great and i absolutely hate when people demand a tip from me  first they need to work on the food  then the service and i dont care if youre an asian restaurant  you dont demand a tip,negative
i was sad when honeybees was gone  i really miss the quesadillas with the fries  and the sandwhiches  when it became yummy bites  it was just oh another asian restaurant  i went to yummy bites with some friends after a career fair and was craving tofu soup  a friend and i shared the soup and bulgogi so disappointing  first  my soup was not hot  it was luke warm and tasted mostly like yucky flavored water then the bulgogi looked like boiled meat floating in colored water sprinkled with something  sad to say  did not enjoy it  theres other restaurants id rather go eat at on the same block,negative
yeah  most aesthetic things and environmental factors surrounding this store suck  as is adequately covered in reviews  but this is not my biggest problem does anyone realize how much stuff costs here you can recognize their absurd markup when stuff goes on sale like 92 off  youd probably spend less grocery shopping at pike place market safeway has to have the worst valueperdollar of any grocery store i am aware of with the possible exception of qfc  which costs more but is owned by the same conglomerate  ie same suppliers different packaging  its not like there arent other stores nearby any student whose little rational economic man allows them to shop here should not be allowed to graduate,negative
blech i wish they would have given me the precooking raw ingredients and sent me on my way  ive never cooked chinesestyle  but dont see how i could have possibly been worse off actually  i think they just ladled all our food out of one of those used grease disposal bins in the alley  this is the slimy chinese food that movie  sitcom scripts always make corny jokes about sucking  not the cheap tasty chinese takeout that has generally been my reality  to add  this was the first time anyone in our group had been here  and we hadnt read the yelp reviews  so we didnt know that you could order lunch at 8 pm our entries were like 10 bucks double suck  and why do all these decent reviews start out with  yeah i know the foods not that good  but its so cheap i can mix some leaves and dirt together  top it with used motor oil  and have a pretty cheap meal  does that necessitate a three star review especially when good maybe cheaper food is within peeing range of their front door,negative
completely terrible a real shame  it seems like such a fun place to go  pad thai is probably my favorite southeast asian food i know good from bad this was awful  burnt dry not in the authentic way  either vegetables shriveled flavors off asked for 5 out of 5 spicy  not spicy at all  bitterness from adding spices late  plus  miserable hostess who gives dirty looks  and overcharges she charged my girlfriend and i 19 for two pad thai dishes  takeout we thought it high  but couldnt verify the price was wrong at the time  because they had no menu with prices listed we found out later  and learned this is not unusual to be overhcharged on purpose  will never go again  im new to seattle  and still looking for good pad thai in u district any suggestions,negative
please dont eat here ive had my fair share of indian food  and ajanta is in my bottom two bland spiceless food  lacking salt  half frozen peas  disgusting and flavorless worst 20 ive ever spent go to murray hill for awesome indian food  not to mention the ambiance is tacky and horrendous,negative
tucked away  i would have always missed this place if my friend hadnt taken me for lunch a deli counter surrounded by wines  various condiments and the greatest plethora of imported sweets  they make mega large sandwiches for about 7 each theyre not overly fancy  like what you would find at panera or le boulanger  but theyre definitely a step up from say subway or the safeway variety the sandwiches were great for their value  and tasted pretty good but the counter service define irritated define unpleasant it was some of the rudest  disoriented service i had ever experienced i had just gotten to the counter and was reviewing the inconspicuous menu when the woman behind it asked for my order there was no one behind me  and i said i needed another minute when the woman rolled her eyes  huffed and cursed under her breath very audibly to her coworker about how i was taking forever i had just gotten there then to top it off  her coworker could not figure out how to group my friend and my order  even though we had explicitly said at the beginning  repeatedly  that our orders were together when they couldnt get it figured it out they got frustrated and did the whole evil glare like it was our freakin fault they didnt hear the first 5 times i never want to go back again they probably have the most random collection of obscure and imported chocolates  and that itself is pretty entertaining but crappy service and not bad but not amazing sandwiches the bottom side of my dutch crunch was soaked in sauce and mustard  rendering the bottom half mushy  no thanks note  also  the majority of goods here look like theyve been around since the 50s and i dont think this would be the ideal place to shop for your market needs such a disappointment,negative
mama dips  1 pricey for what you getskimpy  skimpy servings 2 bland and tasteless or toooo greasy  3 disinterested wait staff  did rachel ray really try the food   i dunnowe tried it about 7 years ago and were disappointed theres people who rave about itso weve tried it a couple times since we always walk out regretting that we stopped in,negative
what am i missing   why is there a line  mediocre food at best   a dirty establishment that needs a good scrubdown  why oh why are so many people fans of elmos i guess its a good thing  otherwise they wouldnt be in business but after all the raves you just have to try elmos  i just dont get it  ive tried it for breakfastif the bar isnt set high  its palatable  ive tried it for lunchtheres so many other places with so much more flavor  ive tried it for dinnerehtiresome  the best i can guess  its location  location  location   save your money and go elsewhereimho,negative
seriously do not give these horrible people the satisfaction of ripping you off     this business is pathetic  their wings are the size of my big toe  the lemon pepper wings taste like my sack after i just got done skateboarding all day  the service is horrible they dont have napkins just really really cheap paper towels  to be honest with you when i bit into one of these puny bch wings i wanted to throw up everything i ever eaten,negative
this place gave me food poisoning the only time i chose to grab fast food on the go  i saw this  and i regret it staff is not friendly what so ever,negative
ugh  i just think dp dough is gross  unless youre drunk and its 2 am  no  even then  just go to hot truck  you could use the walk,negative
ive been here a time or two while ive lived here last time i got a tall latte and a meager slice of banana bread  and it came to nine freakin fifty nine fifty nine fifty it wasnt anywhere nears good enough to qualify that price  and the guy who took my order was indifferent to me and a jerk to the folk he was managing me no likey i do not recommend this place its always too loud and crowded  anyway i hate to tout the starbucks across the street  but the coffees the same and its cheaperbelieve it or not,negative
you can get a pretty damn big beer here  i screwed up and wanted wine  and got it in a coffee mug  wonderful  oh and the hookah is ehh  alright  to tell you the truth  i dont get places like this  if you wanna smoke like this  go buy some flavored cigarettes or something and stand in a circle with your friendssame effect  way cheaper  if you wanna drink  this place is a joke except for the gigantic beer  and if you wanna eatwhy are you here,negative
again  brewco proves to be one of the worst bars ive ever been to  on days that i dont feel like driving to a bar im left with either maloneys oharas or brewco  for some reason my roommate didnt have his current id on him  but he did have his expired one  maloneys said they couldnt take it  then brewco said the same  we waited outside while our 2 friends went to use the restroom and my roommate and i were discussing why his id wouldnt work  i personally dont understand it because the id was issues legally and the information is all the same and he could even verify with other forms of id  one of the bouncers heard this and jumped in on our conversation to tell us that we were wrong  its no legal  why dont you learn something  this asshole kept going on and on and wouldnt let it go  he even told the other bouncer i love getting a rise out of people  he told us to leave  even though we were on public property  and we told him we were waiting for our friends inside  he responded with ill go in there and kick their fucking asses out too  we even tried stepping further away from him  so hed stop provoking us  but sure enough he just kept at it  i and other friends have had too many incidences with bouncers at this place  some of the bartenders are no better  another yelper referred to these guys as sadistic and you cant help but see it in their eyes  even with great service this place is only worth about 2 stars  no matter how badly i feel like staying in westwood to have a beer i will never spend a dime at this place again,negative
boba loca used to quote jesus christ on their plastic cups quite frankly  that creeped me out i just want to drink my fucking boba  man can you leave the lord out of it  please   my korean roommate loved this place  incidentally not quite as much as he loved jesus  though,negative
wow  talk about terrible service  today i ordered ahmos to be delivered to me at work the delivery driver called before he got here and asked me to meet him on the street  instead of the usual coming into where i am when i did meet him  he didnt have my credit card slip to sign  and insisted that i pay in cash  even though i gave  the credit card number over the phone he put me on speaker phone  still refusing to come into the business  and had me talk to someone at ahmos to put my credit card through embarrassing  standing on the sidewalk  giving my credit card number again i called back later  to explain the situation and describe the bad service the manager was not accommodating  instead telling me that he would speak to the driver twenty minutes later  the driver called me back to basically yell at me and demand to know why i hadnt left a tip and why i had called his manager   i think i wont be ordering ahmos again  which is a shame because their food is really good ,negative
this place seeps of msg and gross frying oil ive been here once and i dont think ill ever go back  even if someone paid for my food there are plenty of other restaurants on the ave  go to those,negative
i would have to agree with the previous reviewer this place was not tantalizing whatsoever my fajitas were extremely bland and had a pungent smell to it i was a bit concerned if i was going to catch ebola i didnt even come close to finishing my dinner   one star is generous,negative
i used to walk past this place all the time for the last 3 years and finally had the opportunity to come here with my boyfriend we were craving pho  and normally we go to cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho i got excited we ordered the seafood pho  when it came i noticed there was something immediately wrong the noodles looked suspiciously like top ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but i dug in cos i was so hungry my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different it also had no garnish bean sprouts  basil  no lime  and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup   when we inquired the lack of garnish or lime  we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was special we then asked for srirarcha sp and got a tiny dollop of it all in all we paid 16 for beef top ramen with seafood floating in it it was very salty and unpleasant i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry  multiple theories as to why we were treated this way the couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the limeoil and rice noodles  1 we didnt look asian enough im filipino italian look at my profile picture and my boy is filipino but could pass for latino sometimes they were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we didnt know any better anyway  2 they were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund  3 a combination of number 1 and 2  i guess it serves us right for going into a chinese restaurant for pho but cravings serves multiple asian dishes as well and they got it right what made us the most angry is the fact that the asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied my boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right never again stay away from this place,negative
super super sketch  drive through only people,negative
we made reservation a week in advance and anticipated a great dining experience with family and friends in celebrating a special occasion  after making the reservation   my gf decided to visit the restaurant  a few days in advance to check out the decor and the size of the room that was reserved  the hostess assisted her in viewing the room and guided her through the dining room  before she left  she confirmed the reservation and the hostess assured her  that there wasnt any problems  low and behold  minutes after leaving the restaurant she received a phone call notifying that there was a  conflict in the reservation  the room in particular was already reserved for another party  she was requested to move our reservation to a different time if we still wanted that particular room  as we all know  it is difficult to make adjustments to scheduling especially when it involves a large group     highly disappointed  how can a restaurant of this caliber have a breakdown in communications  unprofessional and disorganized  nevertheless  my gf called back and spoke to a manager to cancel our reservation  management did not express any concerns or give an acceptable explanation  not even a sincere apology  wished we could have complimented on the food that has received several good reviews  however  we didnt even get a chance  i am a strong advocate of great food and excellent customer service  you cant have one without the other  if a business doesnt care about their patrons  why should anyone dine there  as a midtown resident  we will not return even if it happens to be across the street  lets just hope this review catches the eye of upper management and  corrective actions are taken    until then  be warned and hope that this incident never occurs to you,negative
if this bar was a guy he would have a neckbeard,negative
charlies kitchen remains the only place i have ever been cut off from im still not sure why   before i get into that  id just like to say that i actually kinda used to like this place i had probably been there for food  drinks at least 56 times before that incident i could have done without the downright shitty attitude of pretty much all of the american apparel black hoodie uniformed waitresses though i guess you could argue that it is part of the magic of going there oh and the absolutely disgusting bathroom it was easy to overlook with the decent food and cheap drinks for some reason though  i dont know why  after some god awful decision making my boyfriend and i ended up hitting this place up on st patricks day  it was packed inside but the beer garden was open  and we wanted food anyways so we decided to brave the cold and eat and have a few beers outside it was nice out back  and there was a fire going so we had a good time the bartender was nice  she messed up my order but i was still ok with it and didnt complain my boyfriend and i had 23 beers each  it seemed to clear out a little inside so we closed our tab there and moved inside and managed to get two seats at the bar the bartender up there was one i recognized from before  not entirely pleasant but par for the course i couldnt blame her tonight though  with the throngs of absolutely shitfaced college kids filling the place i think we both ordered one gin and tonic each at this point beer was being spilled on me by people walking by  most people were wrecked  she rushed up to us really quick and asked us what drink we wanted next  and my boyfriend hesitated because he was caught off guard and said umill take and she literally walked off midsentence to take someone elses order   ok whatever  so  she comes back a minute later  and we are prepared to give her our order  and she says um im sorry but i cant serve you anymore let me get your check then you can leave  i have absolutely no idea what made her think we were shitfaced i had barely a buzz on i hadnt even really been able to leave my seat and walk around   i would understand getting cut off many of the other several times ive been over served at bars to the point where im barely coherent   i didnt tip her i never not tip anybody i always tip a dollar per beer  more for a mixed if its a little more involved than a liquor and one mixer  20 for meals but fuck that shit   on the way out she yelled no tip never come back at us and honestly she was doing me a favor  have fun getting tips out of your mostly cheap hipster clientele who is more apt to spend their change playing in the aeroplane over the sea by neutral milk hotel on the jukebox than tip you,negative
good riddance  this place was obnoxiously smug  the staff was inept  and the food was overpriced and terrible  really  the best part about this place is that it closed down,negative
eww  what a dirty restaurant the place was not clean it reeked my group waited several minutes for the girl behind the counter to acknowledge us  despite the fact that she could see us standing there she wasnt friendly at all  and repeatedly gave us what huh looks when we indicated what we wanted one our burritos no thanks normally  i love qdoba but this location was awful  the worst part would be the bathrooms do not go in there go somewhere else or you may be scarred for life  so many better options around on mass ave that there should be no reason for anyone else to find themselves at this particular qdoba,negative
my boyfriend and i dined at yummy maki yummy box for a 915pm dinner on vacation in la jolla yummy maki yummy box is a hole in the wall of a shopping center one large bottle of sapporo and one bottle of nigori was served immediately complimentary miso soup was unavailable and substituted by a bowl of teriyaki flavor and chives soup was tasty my boyfriend and i were rushed to order by our server our rainbow roll  spicy tiger roll  holiday roll and complimentary spicy tuna roll arrived in five minutes followed by the last call i specifically requested no mesago on the holiday roll and it arrived including extra mesago the sushi pieces are large  sloppily prepared and lack freshness the entire six tables of patrons exited the restaurant  my boyfriend and i remained inhaling our 50 worth of low quality fish and alcohol and the employees of yummy maki yummy box stood and stared at 950pm my boyfriend and i exited the restaurant followed by the employees of yummy maki yummy box to describe the time it took to meet health and cleanliness standards,negative
my boyfriend and i were driving up to sf and hankering for a snack wanting to make our trip quick  we hurried over to firestone only to see a line out the door dismayed  we headed for another place we had noticed on our walk overmos  now i dont know about everyone else  but when i tell someone i have a serious food allergy to milk im not saying it because im feeling picky or dont like cheese im saying it because im fucking allergic to milk plus wouldnt you think that when i asked if there was any milk or cream in the beans that would imply i couldnt have cheese on my sandwich i expect to be taken seriously  the first mishap was understandablemaybe the cook just forgot or something but when i took it back and told them that i was allergic  they wiped it off with a cloth and brought it back 30 seconds later with bits of cheese still on it my two reactions were  1 you thought you could fool me  2 holy mother of all things unsanitary  finally  they took it back again and brought another sandwich out a few minutes later if it takes you 60 seconds to fire a new piece of chicken and you can make my boyfriends pulled beef sandwich in 30 seconds then thats a bad sign that beef must have been sitting in a warming panit was watery and tasteless  conclusion theres a reason firestone has a line and mos doesnt pick the former,negative
aw hell no  we tipped 5 on a 1239 order 3 slices of pizza  1 order of garlic bread  cos we did delivery even though theyre pretty close went up and opened it to find that  1 the slices were stacked  and the cheese basically ripped off all the pizzas  2 the pizza was thin and soggy 3 i ordered chicken as a topping 40and got onions and garlic instead what 4 garlic bread was kind of tough  got stale when it cooled within the hour  which means it was stale bread that was just reheated  nope probably never again since theres a lot of pizza around la,negative
ugh  terrible service and terrible food  j  i were in desperate need of nutrition after spending most of the morning trying to drag our hungover asses outta bed  nacho mamas was the first place we walked past  so we just decided to go in  we were seated outside and the waiter brought us water and some chips and salsa  we put in our order and waited in anticipation for our food  and then we waited and waited and waited some more  our chip supply had been gobbled up our water had been guzzled down  we were in dire straits  despite the fact that there were at least 8 servers and bussers and floor managers walking around  we were largely ignored  there were maybe two dozen patrons  so it wasnt even busy we asked 3 different guys for more water before we finally got some  the waiter reassured us that our food was on the way at least 4 times    40 minutes after we had ordered  our chopped salad and chicken nachos finally arrived  and they were totally wretched  gross  the beans in the nachos werent even whole beans  it was just some weird brownish liquid that tasted of beans but was weirdly flavored with some sweetish coconut stuff  the salad was just a salad and they only had one kind of dressing  some housemade citrus vinaigrette the guacamole was pretty tasteless as well  never going there again,negative
this was the spot my first year then the racist bar tender told the police my friend was a criminal  they nearly kicked his door in  and proceeded to hold him and his fianc hostage only to realize they had the wrong people what caused the mix up the men were both black  needless to say since this incident ive never given this place a penny   the service was subpar this year anyway before this incident  my friends and i used to hang out here for a nice meal since the fool at our schools dc is subpar at best once thisone umass kid cant think of his name left  its been downhill ever since as far as service goes we always left him a 20 or better tip i hoped it helped   the food used to be amazing but earlier this year prior to the whole race debacle  i had some ribs that taste like they were never barbecued and were cold in the middle as if they were half cooked yuck   im never going here again,negative
the service was really slow i believe it took 30 minutes to get my food after the order was placed i had the ranch skillet nothing impressive youd probably get something better at dennys for half the price the cinnamon dipped apples that came with it was disappointing too i believe it is their apple pie filling  which made me not want to order the apple pie i contemplated going again only for the red velvet waffle but after reading the other review  sounds like that is not even worth it,negative
what the eff yamato  now i completely agree with jill t but heres my most recent yamato experience   yamato  i initially gave you four stars but with your horrific service and attitude towards your customers  i give you 1 star   my experience i came here with my friend sam n and my other friend patrick m i ordered shumai  which did not come until 15 hours later  with no apology  no nothing an hour and a half later for shumai this was supposed to be an appetizer this was supposed to come out before my sushi i was sad and hungry also  sam ns baked lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small  our waitress  never checked in on us which is also why my appetizer took too long and we were sitting right behind the hostess table  not to mention  it took forever to get our check and leave my best friend is a sushi waitress and i can understand the restaurant is busy  but it doesnt excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table  this is really not okay  the reason why i gave yamatos 1 star instead of 0 was because of jesse  my last waiter  who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention i never see at this restaurant i sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of yamato  daryl w has made an awesome point word of mouth is a powerful tool and i have already seen jill ts review on facebook with my fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it   peace out  yamato after the piss poor service and mediocre sushi  im out of here,negative
toms is the worst restaurant on earth  but between naive columbia freshmen and tourists  every single booth is packed  all day and all night dont be fooled the food is awful  the waiters are surly  and everythings overpriced walk down broadway theres plenty of other diners that dont suck below 110th,negative
sadly  i have had to update this review for a third time even though harlem tavern is just down the street from us 3 blocks  and we have tried time and time again to give this place a chance  our most recent visit was enough to repost  let me tell you a little story we arrived at 9pm for drinks because the barinside area was completely swamped  we asked for a table for three we waited around for 40 minutes in the crowded bar area  and were seated in the patio section at 945 as soon as we sat down  we met our waitress  a woman who put down the menus and said are you gonna order food we said no  we just sat down and have already eaten  just drinks id like to add she never once tried to sell us the food  just demand that we order something   a few minutes later  she comes back are you gonna order food you have to order food to sit here  this is my table because we had waited 45 minutes and were never told by the hostess that tables were only for food weve been here 1015 times in the past  and this was never the case we asked if shed make an exception because it was now 10pm and the hostess hadnt informed us  then she starts to tell us they have a new policy a few minutes later  she sends over another server to harass us about ordering food  again  who pleads you just need to order one appetizer  thats all after this  we were fed up and told the staff we would rather leave  she wouldnt bring us the check and disappeared as a result of such poor treatment  we didnt leave a tip   on our way out  we spoke to the hostess  who said the server went rogue and that there was no such policy she even said shed buy us a drink next time we visit i have no idea whether ht has a policy that requires all patrons at their table to order drinks  or if this was just one territorialinexperienced server  but either way we dont plan to return or recommend this joint to friends any longer   sorry  ht  but youre going to have to do a much better job training your staff if you want to succeed,negative
oh man  i really rooted for this place  we were all so excited for a new spot opening in the neighborhood something thats soulful  and characteristic of harlem at large heck  its called harlem tavern  wrong  heres my list of complaints   bad food the mussels in garlic white wine and sweet potato fries were served coldgross but since i had to wait a while for my food  i didnt want to risk sending it back and have to starve for even longer the shrimp cerviche was also halfass done ive had the real stuff in south america so my standard is set high and sure  ive had comparable quality here in the city and lets just say  this cerviche is a 1 out of 10 based on authenticity and taste   limited menu expensive and apparently crappy appetizers  salads  and burgers they all had comparable prices so  theres not much of a price range in your menu choices   limited selection of beer for it to be called a beer gardentavern  its embarrassing that the local supermarket 3 blocks away has a better beer selection   tacky decoratmosphere again  i think we all wanted more character to this place the decor was boring and standard the paintings look like they were bought at a discount from walmart they were playing radio hits right  i really havent gotten enough of lady gaga from the radio alreadyit ressembles any of those tacky tourist joints at time square that i would never venture into and in this case  i only gave it a fair chance because it was brought to my neighborhood  i am thoroughly disappointed,negative
staff is unfriendly they only do take out when they are in the mood which really drives me mad i called and asked for takeout and this is how it went down  me id like to place an order for takeout unpleasant employee we dont do takeout after 7pm me but its 620 unpleasant employee we just dont have time for it right now  dial tone after they hung up on me,negative
so i stopped in today because i was aching for some authentic italian food and was too lazy to cook it myself   what a mistake that turned out to be now  i figured that given the prices this was not going to be the best italian food of my life what i was not prepared for  however  was the sheer blandness of it all the cream sauce was watery and flavorless  and the shrimpscallops were no better i got a sneaking suspicion that the cooks are not familiar with the concept of seasoning the food   now  i was going to give this place two stars because of the value  but regrettably 20 minutes after i finished eating my stomach started doing backflips needless to say i will not be returning,negative
dump   for what you get  overpriced  do yourself a favor go to fresh  easygrab the ingredients  make your ownand actually enjoy a meal,negative
against my better judgement  i ended up eating here again my coworkers wanted come here for whatever reason being the team player i am  i joined them i should have not ordered anything  but i did and i got a little extra surprise a foreign object in my food it was a piece of string or twine and it weaved its way into my rice when i brought it to the attention of the tiny little cashier who looked like she was about 12 years old  the underaged child slave laborer just rolled her eyes and asked me with tons of attitude  do you want another one  well  yea because my stomach was not designed to ingest twine  bitch  when she brought out my replacement rice  i didnt even get an apology when i brought this to her attention  she replied  i didnt do it it aint my fault all that was missing was the south central neck roll i just about lost my mind  if i could downgrade this review to zero stars  i would    original review  i ordered chicken katsu  a side order of calamari rings  and a soda the katsu was decent nothing spectacular  but for the price it was okay the calamari rings were breaded and deep fried they were not crispy there was something mushy underneath the deep fried breading i suspect that it was the uncooked batter whomever was in the kitchen could have let the rings sit in the deep fryer for a couple of more minutes  luckily  my soda was not flat  otherwise i would have knocked one star from my rating  one of my dining companions ordered a sushi roll i was offered a bite i took one as i was eating the sushi roll  i was reminded of that old cartoon i used to see on saturday mornings as a kid dont drown your food they drowned the fuck out of that sushi roll so much so that i couldnt tell what the fuck was underneath,negative
had to wait one hour for food cashier didnt want to give free samosa as advertised on yelp and acted pissed off after i pulled up the website on my phone to prove that the deal really existed  food tasted like it came out of a can bland and generic left the restaurant with a stomach as empty as my wallet,negative
listen  i would choose any local deli sandwich over subway in an instant  but if im in the mood for a crappy fastfood 5 dollar footlong i want it  and i want it faster than the 25 minutes i waited to get it the line was not exceptionally long  the service was simply slow and unorganized how many people does it take to make a sandwich apparently the answer is six thats right  six unhappy and unmotivated workers to make one sandwich i wouldnt be too happy or motivated to work in those conditions  but they wouldnt call it work if it wasnt fake it till you make it guys  so  a deserving 1 star i know  its subway  a chain  how good can you really expect it to be i dont even frequent subway that often  but when i do i expect it to be just as any other subway experience fast and easy they dont call it fastfood for nothing my most recent visit to the drexel subway location was anything but  when you have such a successful chain such as subway  anything with their name on it is probably under some type of quality control customers expect every store to look  smell  and function exactly the same drexels new subway location has unfortunately fallen through the cracks,negative
i went there for the first time for dinner 6pm or so on a friday night  there is only one buffet line to gather all the food you want the cook to stir fry for you  the rice in the cooker looked awful  it looked chunky and not fresh  the line was long and we were hungry  and the food choices were not that great  we ended up leaving the place and decided not to eat there  dont go here if you are starving and wanting food fast  there are several chinese restaurants that can offer more food and much quicker at a lower price than real chow baby  i only went there once and would not go back again,negative
this location is dirty and the food simply sucks  the booths had stains and dried up residue on them  the window blinds were super dusty like they havent been cleaned in ages  low quality food and it lacks good service  this deters me from ever going to another applebees,negative
stay away stay far  far away  this place is like the lady gaga of food theyll throw everything but the kitchen sink at you in sandwich form  fries  cheese sticks  fried pickles  onion rings  eggs  mac n cheese bites  jalapeno poppers  fried mushrooms and more  i know  in theory  it sounds pretty good but trust me when i say that its overwhelming there hasnt been one phat sandwich that ive liked  their wings were also the worst ive had pizza was subpar the panini i tried fresca panini was sickening  summary  only go here as an absolute last resort,negative
dont come here for food i really wanted to like this place since i love the kendall cinema and a lot of the new foodie options opening up in the area  but the appetizers took about 30 minutes to come out the servers were incredibly rude and spacey the sriracha wings had hairs or feather remainders as the waiter claimed garlic parmesan fries were over fried flatbread caramelized onions werent actually caramelized and the fish in the soft tacos was neither fresh  well seasoned  nor cut properly   the menu looks promising but execution is a complete joke seriously there are so many delicious restaurants around kendall no need to go here,negative
at night the store closes its doors for maintenance and daily financial matters from 23am countless times i have stopped by btwn 3 and 330 and the store is still closed i can understand if you were busy and closed later than normal and were behind  but thats why we have pens  write in a new opening time   what is wrong the white kids at night who listen to loud rap music with nr for every other word ever hear of work appropriate   your customer service and reliability are lacking,negative
so  like i said  i normally dont review chains  but i gotta do this bc this place gave me ogeda recently and i will never go back to this particular wendys  so i pull up in the drive thru after a brief excursion at marshalls in the same shopping center and begin to drop my normal wendys spiel  which is 4 combo  medium  dr pepper but this time all i could get out was 4 comb and the dude on the speaker cuts me off to ask what drink i wanted dr pepp again  cutoff to ask the size med okay will there be anything else in a hurried tone i was about to jump through this speaker and choke somebody before i could finish saying  no  thats it i was told to pull around when i pull around guess what i see its the manager taking orders  it wasnt even busy enough for him to be taking orders with the amount of workers there this is previous white castle shift manager experience talking i said woosah a few times and let it slide i dont have time to eff with a fast food manager on his drivethru etiquette now when i go to the wendys in morrisville  this meal costs 740  i have my exact change ready to go for some reason in princeton  this same meal costs 8 i know they can charge differing prices  but it seemed odd  and just added to the bad experience then when i get home an begin to pull the contents from the bag  the fries are in disarray as if trying to escape the bag  and the outside of the burger wrapper was covered in slimy grease i noticed later this grease had soaked through the bag an onto my passenger seat   grrrrrrr nevergoingback,negative
ugh  so i try not to write reviews unless they are positive otherwise  a quiet word with the manager is usually a kinder option however  i was shocked by how bad the service was just now and rather than chewing out the starbucks employee who yelled at me  i thought i would let my thoughts be known on yelp  it probably will have zero impact on starbucks  but hey  bad service is bad service and over priced coffee is over priced coffee     yes  being a barista is a hard job i know  i was one too but frankly they were not that busy and just downright rude and nasty to me the place was dirty and when i asked for milk that was non halfandhalf for my coffee  the barista literally yelled at me call me old fashioned but doesnt the service industry imply  ummm  good or decent or minimally civil service is it too much to ask that someone do something that should already be done  ie they always have at least 2 or skim also out for those of us who cant tolerate halfandhalf   so  dear yelpers  be aware  if you want a cup of coffee you are far better off walking down to espresso royale or sweetwaters  heck  i would chose micky dees any day from now on and given the stupid amount of money i have spent at starbucks in my life  i probably will and my wallet will thank me,negative
im not a fan  that hasnt changed  the four star review  i suspect  is largely the result of the value for college students on a budget  consistent with my earlier review  the downgrade of my rating is largely theoretical  maoz loses a star because its no longer open late night  it closes at 10p sunday thru wednesday  and 11p thursday thru saturday  instead of the original 2a  while i do not anticipate eating its substandard fare ever again  its principal allure  late night eats  has faded into oblivion,negative
went to minami sushi tonight with a large group of friends 20 for a birthday dinner we were the largest group there  but there were 2 other small groups 58 and a few couples long story short i waited for over an hour and a half for a spider roll and received no water refills people in my group and the group next to us had to ask the waitress for water  soy sauce and soy sauce dishes   maybe it was due to the fact that they may have been understaffed but the service was miserable and when my sushi finally arrived it was pretty bland and not the right temperature a friend had a bowl of veggie udon which lacked in the veggie department  blasphemy   1 star for having legit ginger and nice sushi presentation,negative
silky tofu  delicious curries  mediocre thai iced tea oh and weird scraps of metal in my food but the waiter took the thai iced tea off the bill as a consolation the real consolation im still alive to write this tale,negative
sorry hi rise  you lost a customer today and sorry  hipsterthanlife attendant  if your professional life didnt turn out the way you wanted  and now youre stuck serving coffee and pastries to people that you believe to be so below you but listen  the reality is that you work at a bakery and thats what you are there to do  serve coffee  pastries and sandwiches if you have any angst about the job you have to do  the customers are not to blame and theres no justification for such condescending and rude attitude ive been a customer for a while  but ive had enough of you  i do have one thing to thank you for because of your poor attitude  i walked away sans food and decided to get my breakfast sandwich over at crema what a great discovery  they had a huge assortment of delicious looking pastries  great sandwiches  and an upbeat  happy customer service,negative
i was excited about indochinese fusion i had it in india best damn chicken corn soup i had  which is what lured me in they had chicken corn soup on the menu they had an appetizer  entree  dessert lunch deal going on for 12 i sat down for a solo lunch on the patio on a beautiful day  service was unacceptably slow  corn soup was a culinary disappointment  too corny  no other depth of flavor like thickened corn water with corn in it  desi chili chicken  i ate the bell peppers out of it because the chicken maybe the breading were inedibly salty inedible  waited an eternity read 25 minutes for the check guy even got my check and then forgot about me and i had to ask for it back and then when he came back he had split my 20 into smaller bills rather than use the money to pay the bill idk what was going on there  dessert was ice cream on a plate with sparse noodles around it   terrible  ok not that bad but i hate when bad food and bad service waste my time,negative
i went to cardullos today with my husband to purchase champagne for some mimosas we were planning on making  we have washington state ids and were prompted to show them to the cashier  who also happens to be the owner  this was no surprise of course  shed want to check our ids before letting us purchase alcohol  however  she opened up a book that shows pictures of state ids to verify our id  and apparently our two washington state ids did not match the id images she had in her book  and she refused to let us purchase the champagne  while i appreciate her thoroughness  i am completely appalled that she would not let a married couple in our late twenties with multiple credit cards and harvard ids purchase champagne  our washington ids are from july 2010 we have no idea why they dont match the picture in her book  but clearly her book is outdated  and  if we really had fake ids  wouldnt we take even more care to make sure our ids match pictures in a book used to check for fake ids   i will never shop at cardullos ever again as a result of this humiliating and atrocious service  big mistake  huge,negative
pros good food  interesting ambiance  cons extremely poor service that overshadowed the positives  in early february  i was planning an important dinner for a business friend in town visiting some graduate students  i thought upstairs would be the perfect place for an intimate dinner at one of my favorite upscale restaurants in cambridge  two weeks in advance  i made a reservation for 7 people at 830 pm on feb 15th on the upstairs  intimate dining level  the night before the dinner  i received a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for 830 pm  when we arrived at the restaurant  we were told in a joking manner that our table would be ready in 45 minutes we waited 30 minutes  and after not a single update from the host or hostess  i went to check in on the situation  apparently our table was still not ready  because the party before us arrived at 530 pm and still had not paid their bill  we were instead offered a crowded table on the noisy lower level a jazz band was playing which would not have worked for what i had planned to be an intimate  quiet dinner  when i told the hostess that this wouldnt work for us  she was indifferent and said there was nothing she could do  she ignored us from that point on  our party awkwardly waited near the jazz band for our table to be ready  and finally  at 930  an hour after i had scheduled the reservation  we were finally seated  after this atrocious service  i expected the host who seated us to offer us  at the very least  free drinks  but the host offered nothing and i was too embarrassed by the whole situation to even ask for anything  while the food ended up being fine and the service during the meal satisfactory  i am really upset that a restaurant of this caliber treated our party so poorly  i can understand that this was the day after valentines day and perhaps the restaurant was dealing with capacity issues for belated valentines day celebrations this is what the host told me after we finally were seated  however  the restaurant knew i had a reservation for 830 that night and should have planned accordingly   i am really disappointed with upstairs on the square i have frequented this restaurant a few times before and have never had such an issue   the restaurant screwed up pretty royally for what was a fairly important business dinner for me and i have no plans to visit this restaurant again,negative
worstpizzaever   hifis pies dont come close to being north end pizza or even digiornos the crust is hard and tasteless  the cheese is used sparingly  and the sauce tastes like it could be tomato paste   if youre thinking of stopping by for lunch or dinner  definitely keep walkingyoull find something else in a oneblock vicinity this place is only worthy of the desperate  drunk college kids wandering around the central square area but guess what kiddos hate to disappoint you  but not everything tastes good when youre drunk  hifi pizza included,negative
yuck  the only good thing that i can say about this pizza is that it was delivered pretty quickly  other than thati am totally disappointed  thick  greasy  flavorless crust  the veggies all tasted like they came out of a can slimy and even the cheese didnt taste good   i have been a happy beautys pizza customer for the past year  and regret branching out  i would never order from this place again,negative
this place has some much going for it  that i am always surprised by how bad it is  awesome location  right outside of central  with parking  really good looking pastriesbut for some reason  it just doesnt work  it sucked when it was carberrys  and i was really hopeful that when lyndells bought it  it would get better  ive never been to the lyndells in somerville  but ive always heard good things  my biggest complaint is the people who work here  its like all of their employees are terrified of people  they run away rather than asking how they can help  and they do everything sooo sloooowwwly  normally  if im at a coffee shop in the morning instead of at home drinking my own coffee  its because im on m way to work  which probably means im in a hurry  which probably means i dont have 15 minutes to stand in line while the 4 people behind the counter accomplish absolutely nothing  the food tastes ok  nothing special  and majorly overpriced  i would love to have a great bakery right in central  and i would go all the time  ive learned that the bakery at whole foods is my best bet  and will continue to take my business there  good coffee  great pastries  helpful employeesand you can grocery shop while youre there  i just decided to give lyndells another shot today  because it always looks so temptingi literally stepped over a raw chicken breast right inside the door  when i politely mentioned it to the gal who made my sandwich  she acted like she couldnt care less  or why i would be bringing it to her attention  a raw chicken breast  on the floor  ewww   i will not be making this mistake again,negative
first time in and ill never be going again seriously dont even bother going  common sense is something people should look into when hiring staff  i walked in  placed my togo order with the girl at the front  specifically first order not for me  then my order  then an appetizer   i paid and change was 51 cents not that complicated but she somehow gave me 11 cents small issue but ridiculous that she looked confused when i said it wasnt 51 cents   i told her i was going to wait outside for the order she said ok and that it would be 20 min my phone died so i lost track of time but when i went back to check on the order because it seemed like a long time she said here you go i asked how long had it been ready and she said 10 min i assume she just thought it would be a good idea for me to wait outside till they closed and then maybe i would go in and check on my food she just stood there and didnt know what to say i think a so sorry would have sufficed  the kicker was she put both orders of sushi rolls in the same container it was two orders only reason i was particular was because im allergic to seafood and i had the veggie rolls while my friend did not   never again no way no how,negative
ridiculously understaffed only 2 waitersbartenders working on friday night thirty minute wait to order and then to pay,negative
chicken kitchen  clean your kitchen  and the rest of the place while youre at it so  ive been wanting to try this place for a while  its close to the gym  the menu promises to be good and i love some rotissed chicken  heres my story walked in at 7pm and the restaurant is moderately busy  i see there is a family meal that i can get to go and opt for it  too bad there was no rotisserie whole chickens availableat the dinner hour no less  i was told there would be some in 10 minutes  so i decide to wait  i grab a seat and begin to check out the place big mistake  dirty  dirty dirty birds here  the kitchen area needed a serious cleaning and the chopped chickens looked rather dry read  old on the grill  the dining area had not been attended to in quite a while either  after my 10 minute impromptu inspection  i decided this was not the place for me  chicken kitchen  too bad i did not get to taste the food  but i think it just was not meant to be  call me when you get your act together and clean up a bit,negative
i want to start off saying this place went from great to horrible over the past few years  i have heard that they changed ownership  i went last sunday and ordered a hamburger and fries  guess what i got food poisoning  because two hours later i was so sick  my wife ordered the mango chicken salad  well there was hardly any mango three and a half small strips and almost no dressing  the service was okay  but it took a while before the food came out  my friends in line before me had their food 10 minutes earlier    i had the italian cream cake for dessert  but it was okay at best  so basically if you are looking for overpriced mediocre food that potentially can cause food poisoning  then this is your place,negative
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed  on my most recent visit  the waiter was overbearing  the menu confusing  and the food unremarkable  avoid this place,negative
they had mints at the door when  you left  that is about the only nice thing i can say,negative
i cannot adequately express the shame i feel for having the nerve to suggest this place for a mini girls night out i think eileen c already broke it down but i just have to put my 2 cents in and say this place has some nerve it was seriously empty and still we were brushed off like some drop in visitors which we were but hello they are a restaurant wait oh i get it now it wasnt a restaurant that makes much more sense it was an empty room of tables with rude people avoiding eye contact with the confused people who had the audacity to walk in makes much more sense  it is crazy to me that i gave this place 5 stars before i was vegetarian at the time  that is the only excuse i can think of the shame,negative
do you enjoy fragrant  exotically spiced indian food made with fresh  flavorful ingredients if so  this place is not for you hunger  and the absence of a wait drove us to palace of india one warm friday evening when all other princeton restaurants were hopping i looked forward to fulfilling my craving for good biryani which was among the dishes featured in the very reasonably priced dinner buffet   well  as my husband astutely noted  you get what you pay for and no wonder there wasnt a wait i couldnt believe that every buffet item was bland and the harsh  unpleasant textures immediately extinguished my appetite i usually love warm creamy palak spinach with soft cubes of paneer cheese here  the grainy  fibrous palak and hard  rubbery paneer was clearly undercooked the vegetable korma may as well have been dessert given how sweet it was the chicken tandoori was slimy and cold actually all the food was cold after a few bites id had enough   id last visited this establishment a while back when it was known as kalluri corner and the food at that time was decent i suspect the management or ownership has changed  hence the poor quality i will not be going back here and neither should you,negative
so let me begin by saying that  in my experience  i can leave an establishment happy  even if the food or product is semi mediocre  if the employees demonstrate sincere and friendly customer service with that stated  the food at cielo is not excellent  it isnt terrible either however  i could have been pleased if the staff we encountered had been actually sincere and friendly not fakefriendly theres a huge difference either way  heres an account of my latest experience  three girlfriends and i arrive at 10 minutes to 6 when their happy hour ends on a wednesday afternoon we were seated promptly  at a table with no napkins or silverware  and a busser quickly brought us chips  salsa and waters our server however  took almost 10 minutes to approach us when she did  we asked if we could still receive the happy hour discount on drinks and appetizers at that very moment we could hear the clock chiming 6 at the mission  and our server simply said only if its before 6 not a yes or a no she evaded the question with a passive answer  even though all of us could clearly hear the clock chiming 6 pm i told her  politely  we arrived 10 minutes ago and were looking forward to the happy hour prices  hinting with out being outright rude  that wed appreciate the discount since it is barely turning 6pm and we had been sitting there for 10 minutes well  she said shed check with her manager  we each ordered a drink and an appetizer i ordered wine  but tasted my friends passion fruit margarita it was fine  but oddly thick even though it was on ice and not blended kinda weird  but flavorful i ordered the ceviche  which was good  nothing spectacular  but good like i mentioned before maybe i would be happier with the place in general if the service was better  but i think poor service makes the food taste worse when our food came we still didnt have napkins or silverware and our waters were all empty i had to ask for napkins and water refills she brings the napkins but no silverware they are roll ups so i figured my statement went without further explanation we needed the full roll up  silverware and all however  apparently she was too distracted to notice we didnt have silverware my friend asked for a fork  and she giggled oh  i didnt realize you didnt have silverware well duh  youre only our server  arent you paid  to notice these things weve only been here for 30 and youve walked past our table 20 times frustrating  needless to say  we receive our bill and no discount was applied for the happy hour specials i didnt bother bringing it up with her we paid the full prices  which are a bit expensive  and went on our way  i just dont understand  why when all it would have taken on their part was to give us the happy hour prices just priceless moments after the clock chimed 6pm  and we would have all left much happier terrible first impression of a new restaurant in a very crucial economy for new businesses  on a positive  i also really enjoyed their chips they have flour and corn tortilla chips a nice touch i havent had most places,negative
is it really so hard in a city the size of atlanta to have reasonably good asian food in midtown     i like the location of mu lan and the cute house it is in  but the food is the same as one would get in a suburban strip mall in anywhere  usa  disappointing  i know my standards can be high i lived in southeast asia for a few years but  really  why is it so hard for a city the size of atlanta to get some good ethnic food that doesnt require a drive to buford highway,negative
i wish i liked this place   i live upstairs and it has a cute patio  but the food that used to be average seems to have gone downhill  and the prickly pear margarita i used to enjoy seems to have been changed and now is too sweet and ive tried it on different occasions  wasnt just one day with one bartender    i had a craving for nachos the other day and went there for convenience  and ate about 4 bites  really  how can you mess up nachos     service is also slow  inattentive  and faulty   the last several times i have been ive had to ask for a side of salsa twice different serversbut somehow no one can remember to bring salsa  i havent tried the pizza portion of the menu i dont really get the concept of pizza plus mexican anyway  so i cant comment on that  until reading reviews  i never noticed the low health inspection score  but sadly it doesnt surprise me  prickly pear  you literally need to clean up your act,negative
ive been here 3 times  the first time was on a pub crawl  a couple years ago  and i only had beer  and it was pretty good i like to try new beers and they have a good selection  the second time was also pretty good no complaints  so why the one star well i went here last weekend for dinner and drinks before a movie  and i went home with more than i bargained for food poisoning after spending a day over the toilet and another day in bed too weak to move  i will never go here again i probably wont even be able to walk by without dry heaving,negative
alright  heres your pal the boston bachelor back with another review  getting there  practically on top of the harvard square t  dress  casual  atmosphere  na  crowd  usual mix of late night halfsober people  bookworms  and 1 or 2 homeless people on a saturday night  food  stale  drinks  no booze  servicestaff  my buddy deep got the indian discount  guy who manages it is pretty cool  bottom line  wouldnt come here to recover from a night of drinking  definitely not for the food  it might be better during the day  but ill leave that for you to try  and finally  bathrooms were clean,negative

usually i invest a real effort to make my reviews interestinghumorous to trick you into continued reading no sarcasm  no hyperbole this time  but a true 11 scale outpouring of emotion  thisplacesucksbitesblowset cetera i will never come back here read on  let me tell you more  we waited 30 minutes to order from waitress x and waited another 31 minutes afterwards all 6 occupied tables had food on it  regardless of whether they had come before or after us the reason for tardiness invest every available second to harshly wither our burgers into oblivion  every burger was garnished with coal the one wrap we ordered was edible  because there was no cooking involved there i heroically complained to the waitress and manager about my burger not being medium  nor well done  but black and crispy as if blessed with fire and brimstone from mr pointy horms himself i showed him the burnt cancer underside of my burger the manager got angry and proceeded to school me all up and down about charbroiling direct quote follows   the grill top is hot therefore the burgers burned its part of the charbroiling process   it was my turn to give him an angry look i asked if he would make another burger  and he shot back that any burger i would get would have the exact same char i studied the man in front of me for 25 seconds in silence hark do i perceive in front of me the rare and hard to find idiot  did i need to show him that even a onearmed man can flip a burger  starting to look a little nervous  the manager broke the silence by asking me if i wanted him to make another attempt i said no he then asked me if i wanted my order to be made for take out i said no he then walked away i was livid within me was an enlarging node of primal anger that could grant me the strength to punch straight into my victims and withdraw internal organs   my companions could tell i was upset so they asked for the check the manager came back and informed me that he had taken it upon himself to take my order off the check he then proceeded to chum it up with me by asking me if i had any plans for the rest of the day i extricated myself as soon as i could before my dam of hungerenhanced anger burst  0 stars for service 0 stars for food 1 star just so yelp will register my review and post it,negative
this is a sad review  because om started out great  it was  pricey but worth it  service was great and the atmosphere at both bar and restaurant was fantastic  it slid down hill fast  im not sure how they manage to stay open  there is more history in my old review  its gone from one of my favorites to 1 on my most loathed list among places that are still in business   ive had two bad experiences with pricey restaurants in the area  one was at upstairs on the square  one was at om  with the square  management seemed truly appalled  explained the situation and did everything they could to make it right   our followup visit was fabulous and the owner came by to thank us for giving them another try   upstairs were paragons of accountability and concern for the customer  om on the other hand  gave me a huge run around   it took many calls with promised call backs never coming before i spoke to someone who said he was the manager  he made promises that were never kept and left me much annoyed     everything ive heard suggests the food quality has slid further and the sevice and managment have not gotten their act together   looking through reviews  almost all the favorable comments are are about the bar  ill be back to upstairs on the square when i want a pricey meal  i wont be darkening the door at om   41410  tempted by a half price coupon  i checked in with yelp for signs of hope at om   dining experiences still look very negative  bar reviews are mixed  there are plenty of better choices at less than 12 oms prices,negative
the lobsters were the worst weve tried they smell and leaked chlorinated water so much that we even didnt finish them that was the first time in our life  both of us are just crazy about lobsters  and had them a lot thanks for a great evening,negative
this is the worst indian place i ever tried it never attracted me to have a dinner  however i decided to give them a chance and bought a coupon for 30 off the bill that was supposed to be a good motivation and i lowered my expectations but the service and the food was soooo bad that lowering my expectations was not enough to start enjoying the place regarding the food  me and my wife ordered appetizer with shrimps shrimps there were so small that its taste was fully absorbed by chickpeas and yogurt  soup it was ok  tandoori grill also ok and seafood masala it was not tender at all that would be ok unless all entries were served 3 minutes after appetizers of course  we ended up having all the dishes on our small table we also ordered sweet and salt lassis  however  waiter brought us mango and salty lassis the last thing we were surprised with is our waiter we decided to reduce her tips  but she took the check before we left looked at her tips and started to insist to raise her gratuity can you imagine that,negative
peopleread this before you decide to go here   i really enjoy korean bbq  and being that this place is right around the corner from my house i decided to check it out one day my first impression was that the place wasnt too bad  maybe 35 stars its def not as good as a real korean restaurant but still not bad for fast food   however  i just got back from this place and i am unbelievably disgusted i asked for the spicy chicken and the nice guy at the register told me it would take 10 minutes so i got the bbq chicken which had already been cooked earlier in the day while waiting for the guy to make my plate i observed the cook spraying orange chemicals near the grill  actually right on the metal less than a foot away from 10 spicy chicken breasts that were 14 way cooked he did it once and i thought  okmaybe it didnt go on the chicken then i saw him spray it againand then a third time very liberally and yes  the orange chemical spray which says do not drink on the side was spraying up all over the cooking chicken especially on the ones that were closest to the metal he was spraying i mean  as he was spraying the grill was making noise like when you throw water into a fire omg  i was disgusted i told the cash register guy and he looked surprised and i told him that i didnt think i would be coming back   i got home and reluctantly started eating my food the first bite of chicken tasted like rubber and it was sorta pinkish insideso i recooked it in a frying pan it still tasted gross  i think some of it has to do with my disgust at the whole chemical situation  but also cause the chicken really did taste like rubber it didnt taste like that the last two times i came here anywayi wont eat here again if the cook and the 3 other employees that were working back there doesnt realize that spraying chemicals next to cooking food is a hazard and downright disgusting then he will never understand how to cook food properly   eat here only if you want your future kids to have congenital deformities i am seriously considering banning all fast food after this experience you can really only trust homecooked food nowadays,negative
this place blows a big one the server was great at first and convinced us into some expensive sake and then he forgot about us he forgot about one of our rolls and then tried to tell us he already brought it out to us then he acted like he was doing us a favor by bringing out the roll we never got we didnt see him again for 20 minutes and we were waiting patiently for the check boy  i wished id just walked out the check was around 100 bucks for two people for mediocre sushi and terrible service dont come herethat is unless youre a complete masochist,negative
i used to like this place  but now they put a weight limit on how much you can get  if i remember correctly it was like 5 lbs for meat and 5 lbs for noodles and like 5 veggies or something like that my question is how the f am i supposed to know how much my sht weighs to the decimal lb do i look like good will hunting to you i was packin my bowl as i usually do and the cashier lady and one of the cooks starts bitchin at me talkin about i got 1 lb of beef in my bowl wat is the point of even goin to mongolian bbq joints then,negative
i recommend ordering through eat24com thats the only way you can get your money back when this place disappoints you   i ordered and it took 90 minutes i order wings  baked ziti and chicken parm sandwich the wings came wrapped in foil and were soggy because of the condensation the chicken parm was barely warm and the chicken wasnt even breaded i may not be italian but i know chicken parm is supposed to be breaded the baked ziti was sort of ok but the sauce has a weird not too enjoyable aftertaste   needless to say i will never order from here again how can one place screw up so much and still have 3 stars,negative
im not sure who owns this franchise but they are totally wasting their money on rent they dont even have any ice cram in the place i went a while ago and all of their tubs were virtually empty i totally had a hankering for a hot fudge sundae i was disappointed but i sucked it up and headed on over to 21 choices,negative
for this company affair  we had a cut menu  fish filet  steak filet or pumpkinchicken ravioli i ordered steak  my immediate supervisor had the fish and our assistant was forced into eating the ravioli since she couldnt recall exactly what she reserved ill get to the point quickly gross  bland  disappointing the steak could have been anything  but it didnt taste like anything but refrigerator the mashed potatoes lacked any discernible spice or flavor  and the broccoli tasted like the steak the pumpkin ravioli served with chicken cubes  most succinctly summed up in the following quote can i just say that i will forever remember that meal as the most disgusting one ive ever had it was bland and tasted neither like ravioli nor pumpkin  nor anything else that she would ever put in her mouth again the fish dry and overcooked with bone remnants so large  our poor guest had to excuse himself from the table to spit them out we were  however  served a great shiraz and i had the strongest tastiest hurricane that thoroughly rocked me,negative
well normally i do not one star a place unless i have been there twice   well i have  i ate about 3 months ago there and the food was horrible  i went there tonight for a concert aka benny  i got kicked out by the the bouncer for moving sideways on the dance floor which was followed by being let back in by the bouncer because i seemed fine both the man who escorted me out and the bouncer could not say why i was escorted except his dsp bro said too i rate this place one star and my friends parents own it disappointment if you go to native  head across the street to an actual bar bulls   cheers native never getting my dollar again,negative
bleh  i have tried a lot of food at la terrasse and its all bleh  spinach salad  bleh pizza  bleh steak frites  bleh  maybe its because i dont order from their dinner menu  but from their bar menubut their food is very lack luster  head elsewhere,negative
the service her is terrible  our server forgot our drinks and we had to remind her four times  then she was pissed off that we kept bothering her with requests for napkins and forks  the food was over priced and not very good,negative
worst restaurant ever,negative
last week  four friends and i went to hirise on a wednesday  after getting our food  we went upstairs to try to find a table  the place was full of people camped out with laptops and coffee at 4top tables  when we asked a staff member if there was anywhere else to sit remember  were all standing around holding a basket in one hand and a drink in the other she said no and disappeared  we ended up eating in the conference roomtheater of the next door community center  with the curtains drawn  bottom line get takeout  or eat outside if its nice but dont come expecting to eat in,negative
i dont like the texture of the crust i know thats what people go for when they come here and they enjoy the flakiness  but it is just not my cup of tea the crust to topping ratio of some of the pizzas that i got were also not good   the mixtures of toppings are pretty creative  but other than that  im just not into it its the crust that really throws me off,negative
a typical night at studio 4 would consist of the following  1 waiting in line for 12 an hour in the blistering cold of michigan  figuring out whether the girl in front of you is wearing a tube top as a skirt  and dealing with the jack ass bouncers who have just begun their careers as club bouncers  building up their resumes in hope of one day ending up in la or nyc  as part of the alist of bouncerskeep dreaming buddy  2 once you manage to not get thrown into the cement by the bouncers  congratulations  you have passed the first stage  now your next task will be to manage not to get kicked out because they will find every reason to do so  a few tips  dont wear hats  dont fall asleep on their couches  dont have beef with the bouncers or bartenders  dont have beef with the rest of the people in the club  dont drink to the point where youre so drunk that you get kicked out and have the nerve to stand back in line while dressed in a halloween costume in hopes that the bouncer will not recognize you  and then reaching the point where you are banned from the clubyeah i happen to know someone whos had this happen to her before  i know her really well actually    3 so  once youre finally in the club  chances are youll probably see an empty dance floor and wonder why the hell they made you wait outside for 12 an hour  this is called strategic marketing  4 once you realize that your hoedar is excessively sending off signals  that everyone around you looks like a serial rapist  sex offender  or just plain wasted to the point of no return  you will decide to join the wasted to the point of no return group and head straight to the bar where you will rack up a tab that you will cry over while hugging the toilet the next morning  5 eventually later on in the night  you will realize that you have to make that dreadful trip to the bathroom  since im a girl and i dont have the luxury of relieving myself in 3 seconds  i usually have to wait in a long line full of crying  emotional wrecks who swear they will kill the bitch that their boyfriend was grinding up on the dance floor  once you get through the door  you will also have to push yourself past the girls blocking the 2 bathroom stalls who think taking pictures of themselves with the bathroom as backdrop will look hot as their next facebook profile picture  if youre lucky which you probably wont be unless you go clubbing at 9 pm  you will be able to get a toilet either not overflowing with puke  feces  or flooding the rest of the bathroom with toilet water  be careful when you wash your hands too  chances are someone thought puking in the sink would be a better idea than puking in the toilet  so there you go  i think ive had more fun clubbing in my bedroom with the disco light i won at chuckie cheeses  the only reason why i give it one star is  not just because yelp does not give me the option of choosing zero stars  but i have to admit  some of the funniest memories that werent funny at the moment of occurrence happened here p,negative
meeting streets business model sell the cheapest food possible in outrageously huge portions thereby convincing people that theyre receiving a bargain  lets look at an example a cup of coffee it costs over two dollars for a cup of regular drip coffee why because rather than serving it in a humanstyle coffee cup  they serve it in something more resembling a small vat heres the thing big wide containerhot coffeesoon to be cold coffee  so its not like youre actually gaining anything for paying for more because  this is america  and you get free refills anyway and its not like the coffee is anything special its just that by giving you a ton of it and you are momentarily blindsided by sheer enormity and do not realize that you are being ripped off this same fault can be applied to everything on their menu  their menu itself is enormous  schizophrenic  and the great majority of what actually comes walking out of the kitchen while portioned for giants or something is bland  unimaginative  sad this isnt good breakfast food this isnt good deli food and it sure as hell isnt good dinner food i feel sad for the person who pays 12 for the chicken and broccoli when they could have walked into the vdub for essentially the same thing i wont even comment on the utterly strange decor  their lame policies like ending breakfast at noon on weekends  or how flipping rude the people behind the counter are rolling their eyes when you ask for a glass of water i know they have to deal with a lot of students  and that can make anyone jaded  but for gods sake  you made this bed  eat in it and go look up how big a sandwich is supposed to be   there is one reason it makes sense for people to go here they are byob and do not monitor it at all once you turn 21  go down to georges and have a real sandwich,negative
lets put aside the obvious issue of authenticity for a moment and discuss the real problem quality their food is disgusting for a reason its really  really cheap everything comes of a bag the soups come out of a bag  their guacamole comes out of a bag  the empanadas are prefab and frozen  even their house recipe hot sauce is actually just from a big cisco jug their business model is simple flashy decor  glossy menu  and steep prices means that people will believe that what theyre eating wasnt frozen on a truck that morning its a really sad way to treat customers  employees  and the community these people dont deserve to make money,negative
everything that comes out of this place tastes like its been frozen i think its sad that the same guy whos tricking wickenden into thinking abes is a bar is tricking the hill into thinking this is bbq while  yes  this is the north and we cant expect great bbq  united bbq is not great bbq  not at all,negative
horrible  they ought to call it side order plantation as there is no real food here  like someone blow said  it feels like they are hiding the entree buffet stations   it disgusts me that there is no real protein anywhere  unless you pay extra for the baggie of chicken for the salad,negative
120507 its really tough to get me upset or disappointed  but this place seem to have accomplished that exactly walked in and was greeted and seated immediately the tables were so close together it was a little annoying people who sat next to me can literally just share food with me mine as well it was not crowded or busy just good amount of people sitting too close to each other  the waiter had the craziest accent ever it was really hard to understand him  i had him repeat the specials twice he told the specials to two tables at a time i mean he had to we were so close that it was almost as if everyone was one big table  of course bread was given to us by our waiter  and it was horrible it was hard as rock we saw other tables get bread as well but it looked really soft so we ordered another basket of bread with someone else and they brought us nice soft warm bread i think this waiter hate us its like he doesnt care i ordered the steak dish on the special i also ordered the pinot grigio the wine was great the steak dish was not steak it tasted like fish it was soft like fish and it has no steak taste to it yes it was smothered with some cream sauce and mushroom but no steak in there just tasted like fish and mushrooms i was very disappointed with my dish so i didnt eat it  the waiter came by and he try to take my dish away to get me something else i told him i didnt want anything else and its okay cause i already lost my appetite he grab my plate and i told him to leave it he kept on insisting and he end up yelling at me whoa i seriously was gonna slap him in the face asshole it was really intense argument he walked away and said well i dont know what you want hellllooo you freaking idiot i just said leave me alone i dont want anything else did i fckin stutter well of course that was all said in my head what a dumass i came with my good friend lily and she was upset too her dish was not good at all both disappointed we decided that you cant go wrong with dessert so we were right dessert it was i got the molton chocolate cake it was freaking good so one star for that thats it nothing else was good i forgot his namedamn that stupid waiter,negative
i called this place to order some takeout  but the number was disconnected double checked the number on the restaurants website and there was no mention that this place is closed for construction,negative
i really feel bad about giving a onestar review  first  its not about the service  price  decor  or the food  im writing this review after going there twice  the first time my husband and i went  the dinner was good  we thought this place has the potential to be our goto chinese restaurant in pgh  today i remembered that they have an earlybird special 36pm msat  the won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasnt bad  the entree was fine    what really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobaccocigarette smell from the tea     i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum  the smell wouldnt leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine 23 minutes then brush as long as i could to get rid of the smell  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray    first visit 3 stars  second visit 5 stars   2 stars,negative
i will never again go here  im tired of the lady that always seem pissedoff taking my order or making me boba   last time my husband and i went  we checked their hours on the door and walked in the door was unlocked the lady yells at us  rather rudely  dont you see lights off   first of all the lights were not off it was dim it was our first time going after sunset we thought it was mood lighting   second of all as if the pissedoffed service wasnt bad enough  we had to be yelled at  i never thought their food was that great anyway ive heard my chinese friends say that shes nice well as a nonchinese speaking person  ive only been rudely serviced over and over again   go to little asia for chinese food and lulus for boba or walk in if you dont see the old lady working there,negative
lovely red velvet cupcakes until i found a blonde hair in one of them ugh,negative
ordered pad thai  crab rangoon  and beef teriyaki from here  the pad thai was terrible it was bland with zero of the flavor pad thai is known for it tasted like plain noodles with no flavoring  with a crap load of ground nuts sprinkled on top which is basically what it was it was a huge portion  but that means nothing when it isnt worth eating  the crab rangoon were overcooked to the point they were dark brown  though they didnt seem like they would taste very good even if they werent  the beef teriyaki was tough  and only mildly flavorful this was probably the better part of the meal  but would have only been recommendable if not so tough and overdone  i recommend highly against this place,negative
roughly 20 or so years ago  this then teenage boy discovered a love for frozen yogurt  when the then it froyo chain opened up tcby stores across an unassuming massachusetts it wasnt ice cream  it wasnt soft serve it was yogurt and it was good  fast forward to today id been looking forward to this place opening after reading and hearing all sorts of things about this amazingly delicious pinkberry concoction that folks on the west coast couldnt get enough of passing by harvard square today  i saw it had opened  and walked in to tryand like the virgin who gives up her innocence to that ratty jock who claims he loves her just because he wants a piece of her pinkberry  only to leave her the next day  i find myself feeling more than a little bit of disappointment and remorse   in fairness  all i knew is that this place serves healthier frozen yogurt a sign on the wall suggested it is tart  which concerned me slightly  but only a bit when i put the first spoonful of green tea yogurt into my mouth though  i must have winced noticeably it tastes like the stuff is mixed with a ridiculously overpowering berryflavored powder  whose strength would put sour patch kids to shame  with the tiniest hint of green tea flavor  and so i am left to believe that this amazing treat ive heard so much about  is nothing more than hype tell enough people its brilliant  they will start to believe it despite their own tastebuds pair that with unbelievably slow service  and pretentious prices that such a hideous flavor doesnt deserve to charge  and i will surely be steering clear of this berry in the future,negative
weve ordered a couple of times from this place  and honestly its been pretty terrible overall their pasta and sauce are bland and expensive for what you get   we ordered chicken fingers tonight  and they tasted like the oil they were cooked in hadnt been changed for a week and a half chicken shouldnt taste like various kinds of fish and clam   their fried raviloi were rubbery  and the sauce that came with it was watery and lacked flavor   there are much better places to order from in cambridge,negative
i didnt enjoy the food or the experience  the food was poor quality  according to my taste most of the ingredients on the bar were frozen  and the sauces had that chemical  massproduced taste and aftertaste  that lasted for hours the rice was horrible  probably some frozen rice that hadnt been properly reconstituted  so the grains were hard and undercooked  the experience can be fun for some  but i do not enjoy standing in line after every few bites of food the bowls are very small  so you eat a few bites  and stand in line again waiting for the food to be cooked  my husband and i are vegetarian  so every time they would cook our food on the grill  they would take a lot of care to clean it first that was very nice of them  but i did not enjoy feeling special and slowing down the line luckily  it was not crowded that evening  the service was good  everybody at the lafayette location was nice  attentive  and hard working,negative
this place was horrible and i will not be coming here again   the place is huge  lots of seating  looks small from the outside and you have to park on the street   i came here with my boyfriend because we are always looking for indianpakistani restaurants to go to  but this place was a regret the food was so bad  that we took 3 bites and left that was also 17 down the drain which made me mad   we got there and ordered so far so good  we grabbed water and sat at a table  and before we could push our chairs in  a guys brought us our food we both looked at each other like hmm that was really quick   so we tried our chicken tikka masala with our naan and plain rice  and the taste was terrible there was absolutely no flavor  the sauce was lukewarm and tasted like tomato soup it was disgusting not to mention  the chicken pieces are tiny and they give you a very little amount  this is definitely cheap  tasteless college food,negative
so dirty  while having dinner  a guy from our next table jumps out of his chair to come over to us he points his finger at my husband and warns him not to freak out we are both scared by this crazy stranger  it turns out my husband was accompanied by the biggest cockroach he or i have ever seen in our whole entire lives it was as big  if not bigger  than those hissing cockroaches yuck yuck  we were so traumatized that we dint remember if the food was good actually we are still trying to forget that we even went inside this place,negative
like shrada a read her review  i wish there was a 0star option my experience was almost as horrible as hers    the service  experience   we walk into the restaurant  and we stand at the front for a full 3 minutes waiting to be seated  even though the restaurant is empty the two employees at the register kind of glance over and continue their conversation  the waitress comes up to us  and right of the bat asks  for here or to go we say for here  and sit down she then comes to us in a few minutes and says in an annoyed tone  i thought you said to go she rudely props two glasses on the table and gives a exasperated sigh  the whole time the waitress has a look on her face like she just defaulted on her house loan  was hit by a pie on the way to work  and slapped by every customer that ate there today  every few minutes shed come by the tablenot to fill up water  but to eavesdrop can you believe this   she had a look like we had just murdered her children and she was trying to find out where we had hid the bodies so then she could kill us once she got that info   the food   terrible if the food has been even average  i may have given 1 star it wasnt   some of the most bland  uninspired trash i have ever eaten i think i can get a better meal out of a barn trough the potatoes were basically swimming in a curry that was water  and the cholay were served uncooked right out of the can  lukewarm and bland   parting ways   the waitress literally throws the check on the table  without us even asking for it i kind of wanted to get up right there and give her a piece of my mind  but i didnt want to ruin my mood for the bar we were going to next doorwhich by the way had been playing earsplitting music the whole time so loud the water in the glass was vibrating  this is absolutely the worst treatment i have gotten in my life  at a restaurant or otherwise this happened about a month ago but i didnt have the time to write and i agree with shradha  the free market needs to send this rathole a message,negative

the food moderately priced but hardly good  maybe i shouldnt judge based on my one experience  but both my friend and i left with upset stomachs    theres much better curry in berkeley  get out of your comfort zone and stay away from these chains,negative
overrated  the insane amount of sugary toppings testify to the fact that cinnaholics baseline cinnamon roll just isnt impressive  the texture is too squishy and everything is just unbearably sweet  vegan treats are no new thing,negative
food is okay ive had better japanese food its not as expensive as joshuyas but the food quality is quite distinguishable  unfortunately  but why am i complainingtheyre supposed to be open till 10pm   10 pm my butt  not tooooo upset because at least it means theyre treating their workers well not working them overtime  but from a customers perspective  not too cool my friend and i practically ran here from the bart so we can make it on time got there at 930 but they refused to serve us because it was too close to closing boo,negative
i would actually give this place a 05 stars if i could not only was the food bleh  the service was absolutely terrible the men working there were probably the rudest ive ever seen eating there for dinner with friends  some of us took our time trying to guzzle down the nasty food while trying to enjoy a nice conversation after about 30 minutes  one of the workers comes over to ask us to eat faster and telling us this is not a cafeteria hes sure right about thatthe school cafeteria has both better food and nicer workers,negative
not excited about this place fine  i give a star for having tart yogurt and having okay toppings the fruit was okay  but some of it seemed canned and sugared  the yogurt tasted a bit grainy and even watered down the tart yogurt could be much creamier but it tasted like it was watered down   i wonder how they clean the machinesconsidering how many they have they cant clean all the machines every day especially when they clse late   and honestly  i think i would pay a bit more for quality im not excited to see piles of trash that cant be composted this is berkeley we need to learn to help our environment   sometimes it scares me to think what kind of germs live on the handles and spouts when a lot of people have touched it then  i saw some kids quickly putting their heads under the yogurt spout to eat itseriously not pleasing,negative
no way  seriously no way  theres two types of yogurteven pinkberry got sued for using powder form and this one def tastes like powder formmaybe thats why theyre called italian delicacy instead of frozen yogurt  i dont know but ive tried it on different occassions and i really cant stand that it tastes artificialnot like yogurt at all  the  fruits were okay but there were various canned fruits like peaches and bluberries im not looking to buy things like thatid rather have it fresh since im putting money into it definately would rather go to yogurt harmony,negative
overpriced and skimpy servings the place actually on telegraph just around the corner is far better,negative
um  i was surprised at the amount of people that like this place  i mean there was nothing good about my experience there the shakespeare sucked ass  the sounds were loud enough  just indistinguishable everything about this sucked  and i had a pissed off girl she was not happy with my choice thank you shakespeare tavern,negative
so  let me preface this by saying that i am a native new yorker i have spent most of my life there  and they do hot dogs pretty well any dirty water dog is far superior than the shit this place parades around as food the buns are trash  the food is trashits hard to ruin a hot dog  the place was packed for some unknown reason  and the staff doesnt seem to give 2 shits about anything i have no idea why this place is an atlanta institution  i have no idea how it is still open i will never go back  and my life is far worse from going in the first place they should just replace this place with a cardboard factory  or concrete factory  and atlanta would be far better served,negative
72309 update the health department shut them down today  maybe tom will come out of the woodwork and start cooking again when they reopen  dont go until he does  this place use to be great  the best thai in seattle  and it was well worth the wait  the cramp quarters  the noise  to marvel at the cooking skills of tom  but now  well now tom is who knows where  on a thia beach perhaps taking it easy   and the people working there just dont give a dam in fact theyll tell you straight to your face you can go elsewhere we have many more behind you  now days  being asked to change seats  even midmeal is not uncommon it happened to us and the table next to us tonight  the prices are up and the quality is down  and its still just as noisy and cramped as before    if this restaurant was anywhere else in the city they couldnt get away with treating customers like they do  please  go elsewhere and let these jackasses get the message they need to treat customers with respect  just say no to thai tom ,negative
granted  i was there only two weeks after opening  so they may have been just getting in the rhythm of menu choices and service  however  running out of three different dishes on the menu  the wine was a rip off  at 10 a glass for a small pour  not going back again,negative
terrible service  food good im familiar with callendars menu  way outdated decor  the place needs a complete redo  the hostess ended up helping us with our order because the waiter was so slow  too bad  because marie callendars used to be so popular,negative
incredibly rude staff,negative
this is the robeks located right next to chipotle  quiznos and coffee bean in the usc area i have gone here a couple of times and the smoothies have tasted watered down they are pretty popular though with the other people i work with and in an area filled with nothing but junk food  we pretty much have no other choice with that said i needed to come here to get 10  5 gift cards for work we were giving them out to our weekend staff because they did so well with all the sales i came here last saturday morning and asked for the cards they were out uhoh now what i just promised my staff robeks cards i asked the guy is there any other way of getting a certificate or something he told me this is verbatim you could get 50 smoothies ok this guy is a moron for 2 reasons i am not stating his name just to be nice reason 1 i am not taking out 50 smoothies to my car and taking them to work to thank my staff for the great work they did reason 2 if i can get 50 smoothies for 50 that would be an amazing deal i kind of stood there stunned for a minute and decided not to say anything to him and left i went back 4 days or so later still no cards i asked when they would be in and the guy told me that when they run out they order them from the main office and they send them whenever they feel like it so either this guy is lying and that location is just lazy and never ordered them or the main robeks office needs to change staff to someone who will take care of their locations again i left empty handed i decided to email the main office i got a very fast response from mitch he gave me an offer that sounded ok but it wasnt for the 5 cards i had promised my staff so that offer didnt work out i explained to him that when other businesses run out of something that a customer needs they will hand deliver the items this happened to me with jamba juice before and they handled it much better after putting me on hold for a few minutes he came back on and said that there will be cards at this location in the next hour ok so trip 3 today i finally get the said cards but not after waiting 10 minutes for the girl to understand what i was purchasing and another 20 minutes waiting for her to ring it up mitch told me this service was not the norm but after reading the other robeks reviews it seems that it is the norm many locations are always out of cards and service is consistently lacking i will never get robeks cards for my staff again bad service and notthatgood smoothies,negative
really rude people work here and they act like they dont know what youre talking about when you order a white chocolate mocha also  i went here 2 days ago and got a med sized drink then i went today and got a small today i paid almost a dollar more for my smaller drink when i looked at the menu reading what a white chocolate dream was i was looking on the blended side then the manager or owner guy older and bald raised his voice at me saying all of our drinks are hot or cold you need to read in the right place do you understand what it says i couldnt believe it so i was charged wrong one time or the other or both and the manager was rude and the server nancy acted like i was stupid ordering a white chocolate mocha instead of a white chocolate dream,negative
im never going back here again  the only good thing i can say about it is that its cheap and looks clean  however  the falafel is ridiculously oversalted  which makes me wonder what other nasty tastes its covering up  the tahini is drab and flavorless  i respect amirs as a small business  but when im in the mood for falafel  i will happily spend twice as much and walk twice as far to go to maoz  this was gross,negative
yikes terrible stay away   if you think ajanta is the best indian food youve ever had  youve got another thing coming a couple of pet peeves i have with indian food is when restaurants start throwing in broccoli and zucchini into some of their mixedvegetable dishes  and ajanta unfortunately does that at every available opportunity its a little unfortunate that ajanta is so poor  because theyve got such a great location right next to columbia oh  well,negative
normally  i could care less about a mcdonalds because really  youre getting what you pay for  however  this particular morning i just wanted some coffee on my way to work  figured id check first to see if it was crowded  and to my surprise  nope    walked in  stood on line behind a gentleman and waited to make my order  except there was something weird going on  there were two employees in the front making coffee does it require that many people to make coffee with an industrial machine  no and four employees standing around in the back talking  why wasnt anyone taking my order  two minutes later  the gentleman in front of me gets his coffee and im left standing there waitingwaitingwaitingwaiting some morei look at the girl at the counter with the fake eyelashes on as she says to her coffeemate  i aint takin no orders until selisha or whatever her name was gets off her phone  really  so saidemployee selisha or whatever walks by on her cell phone chatting away  so i look back at the girl as she then looks at me    me  is anyone taking orders her  whispering to her friend i dont think they understand me  i said i aint takin no orders  thats when i realize i have walked into the middle of a sht show  i turn on heel and walk out  on my way out  i say to the homeless guy who holds the door open for me hoping for change  looks like youre the only one working here today  theyre not taking any orders  sheer incompetence  if anyone feels that theyre above taking orders as theyre working at mcdonalds  they should do everyone a favor and just leave  for anyone who reads this and is still considering going there to eatyouve been forewarned  dont count on anything good coming out of that place lol,negative
used to come here all the time  the food was decent and the service was typically pretty good and accommodating if they werent stacked with customers however  they recently changed management and the last few times ive gone the service has been terrible even with the restaurant nearly empty apparently most of the older servers quit after changing management nowadays most of the orders come out wrong  drinks dont get refilled if you get them to begin with  and what food does come out is bad  dont really plan on coming back,negative
i concur with the rest of these reviews skip this place ive had better cupcakes out of a box these cupcakes are dry  old and have crusty frosting  and if you still end up going  definitely skip the red velvet cupcakes,negative
the mango slushee from the machine tasted like mold or cleaning chemicals  we couldnt decide  the samosas are okay and very spicy  this place has a cheap indian buffet that i havent tried yet,negative
i wish i could give this place negative stars 0 for mediocre drinks 1 for weird smells 1 for rude bouncers 1 for long lines 1 for trashy crowd 1 because its earls why are you even here,negative
nothing new to say  just echoing below sentiments  burger was thoroughly overcooked  and quite terrible  i asked them if the fries were the same as pts and the response was oh  the lemon pepper kind  yep  theyre the same  by that  i guess he meant they put lemon pepper on them as the one spice they could identify  because thats all they had on them just lemon pepper  remember how pts fries had about 10 different spices that merged for a delectable taste mmm  i wanted to like this place  i really did  i will never come back  and thankfully theres a buns for my fry fix,negative
warning warning warning   do not enter if you are  a 33  b sober   mind you  im usually a make the most of any situation kinda girl but dang last night came here for karaoke after game 7  go lakers  i had a sudden impulse to line up all the obnoxious  belligerent  20something undergrads together and knock them all over with a bowling ball   highlight of my night here was when this stupid blond girl kept interrupting everyones karaoke song and was on stage beatboxing and singing along louder than the singer i asked the karaoke dj to turn off her mic since she was being so rude and annoying and when he did  i took absolute pleasure in seeing her tap on her mic and shake it to see what was wrong with it haha cheap thrills  ,negative
their table service might be one thing  but i ordered delivery tonight and it was a disaster  the food came more than an hour late a good 90 minutes after the initial order was made  and was ice cold  the restaurant did not call me to warn that the food would be coming late  i had to call them  i guess my tonkatsu was good once  but it was slimy and congealed by the time it reached me  wont be ordering again  wont be making a visit stay away from this joint,negative
ouch the absolute worst brunch service ive ever experienced took almost 30 minutes and asking 3 times to get my cup of coffee  and a little longer than that to get my bloody mary ordered at the same time  food was pretty standard brunch fare  too many other options like zingermans to ever go back,negative
i just cant recommend this place  unless youre interested in mediocre food at high prices served by inattentive waiters  the only reason i went here was to bring a group of family and friends this was convenient and could easily handle a large group otherwise  id never  ever go back,negative
im amazed that this place has a 4 star rating  came here today and paid 10 for a giant size sandwich not only does the sandwich have barely any meat on it  but i could probably get a better sandwich down the street at fresh grocer  or subway for that matter roast beef and turkey is dry and tastes old  and for a place that calls themselves a deli to only have 3 types of cheeses is a little ridiculous   maybe i should try it for the egg sandwiches,negative
pattaya grill is unfortunately the only thai restaurant in university city that delivers it is also terrible my girlfriend and i ordered simple thai dishes house salad  papaya salad  pad seeyu  and spicy squid all of these dishes were below average  with the exception of the squid which was inedible it was rubbery and not even cut in peices the house salad also was about as average as a side salad you would get an italian restaruant unless you absolutely need thai food delivery  dont order from this place go out or pick it up or get something else,negative
i have been a few times  and i hate to give it a bad review  but here goesnormally  id give this place 3 stars good location university city  great food deals cheap wings not fantastic but cheap in price  1 tacos  3 for more substantial tacos are economical but ya get what you pay for  really also has generally good drink specials  but lacks on the higher quality brews that i generally go for all in all it  it is great for when you are a hungry undergrad that wants to get drunk with friends on campus perfect  good for you heres the bad part  service has always been terrible for the handful of times i have gone there their waitstaff doesnt seem to give a shit if they get your order correct the waitresses can look hot til the day is long but if you cant bring me what i ordered  go work at a strip joint   also  on our last visit  will be the last time we will ever go there we had the pleasure of finding a piece of broken glass in one of our pints some background for you my friends  i are phdeducated and very respectable citizens that kept our cool and brought this to the attention of the manager  mike mike said we didnt have to pay for the drinks we had ordered well  that was nice of him  until he lied to us turns out  he left the most expensive pitcher on our bill  so again we asked to speak to the manager mike in the full force of a complete asshole blew us off when we tried to explain to him that a trip to the er would have been thousands of dollars more expensive then a 9 pitcher my good friend almost swallowed the piece of jagged glass seriously  what complete degenerates do they have running that place,negative
t bowl deserves an award for being the biggest insult to asian cuisine in philadelphia this place somehow manages to do the impossible and give you everything you wouldnt want to happen to a stir fry what makes a stir fry good well for one thing it uses high quality ingredients  remains unsaturated with oil when flash fried  and has juicy bits of meat scattered in and around the bowlrice  so what does t bowl do wrong let me outline it for you as follows  1 the chicken is probably the driest piece of meat you could ever sink your teeth into it sucks the moisture out of your mouth and tastes like its been cooked days in advance i dont appreciate cotton mouth for lunch  2 your stir fry is greasy as hell you could probably squeeze out a few ounces if you tilted your plate and fried a few eggs with it  3 the rice tastes like death its crumbly and old whoever made it obviously isnt getting paid enough   4 the whole concept is flawed its a fast casual restaurant that has a cool customization theme to the dishes that caters to students and then it overcharges you for everything  to the very last spring onion  5 the presentation of the dish sucks it just sucks have a little finesse in your presentation it takes 5 seconds to make the plate look infinitely more appetizing than seeing the oil splashes all around the dish   6 wtf kind of sauces are you offering what a terrible range of westernized tastes each one attempts to drown out the stale taste of the ingredients which i suppose was the objective  this was an even worse business decision than taglios  which actually tasted good on occasion   i was so excited to hear about this place when it opened  but never have i been more disappointed   what a shame  15,negative
horrible lunch service  we waited 5 minutes to be seated  10 minutes to get menus  and 15 minutes for water when we finally got our burgers we werent able to flag down a waiter to bring us ketchup eventually we got so sick of waiting that my friend just walk up to the shortorder counter to snag the ketchup  never again,negative
675 pretax for a salmon crepe salmon  nata cheese  and the crepe wrapping  my crepe arrives  no nata cheese  i ask the cashier for nata  sorry  we ran out of nata  i ask for a different crepe  the cashier refuses  and instead offers me ricotta i think cheese  i say wouldnt ricotta be gross on a salmon crepe the cashier agrees and says sorry  no offer of a refund  when an item only has three ingredients  you cant expect to get away with two,negative
pro location is great  con sandwiches are bland and thoroughly mediocre  the caesar salad i got today was 7  and it had almost no caesar dressing  it did have a mound of supermarket lettuce and four burnt croutons  no thanks  coho  treehouse has a 5 caesar salad that is about twenty times better,negative
absolute travesty of a burger asked if it was from frozen patties  and they told me no not positive  but im pretty sure i got a microwaved frozen patty utterly disgusting,negative
you know when you hear something so disagreeable you bypass anger and move straight to sadness best burger in providence i honestly feel ashamed it is inedible as in i hadnt eaten in hours  had a few beers in me  love burgers more than almost anything  and still couldnt get past two bites it is a greasy pile of processed garbage unfit for human consumption onion rings sucked  too,negative
first visit and never again irish bar my shamrock arse tattoo  20 minutes to get a waitress attention  and she was shocked by the order of two guinness and two shots of jack  she then disappeared for another 10 minutes and left promising us a menu 20 minutes later  we got a menu i looked at the food landing on the tables around us  and was not impressed with the theme of straight from the freezer to the fryer and talked my companion into going next door to the istanbul we spent an hour at oneals  30 minutes waiting for a drink  and the rest wondering what the hell was so popular about the place,negative
i stopped for lunch at the cafe bistro while shopping at nordstrom this afternoon we were seated and had to leave the restaurant because we could not get servedafter 15 minutes we still hadnt ordered and we still had no water  it looked as though the waiter was responsible for most of the restaurant it was very disappointing and i dont plan to go back   this cafe is a definite step down from the old nordstrom cafe   we then went to pf changs on the other side of the shopping center we were seated immediately and received excellent service,negative
i am a chipotle fan  that being said  this has got to be the crappiest chipotle in the la area   i work nearby  and it was only my love of chipotle that kept me coming back like an abused wife who doesnt want to press charges on cops  but ive finally decided to leave  slow lines  i waited 40 minutes to get to the counter to order my burrito crappy service  staff members here are rude and give you major attitude   quality  at this particular location  they really skimp on the ingredients   is there a short supply of sour cream   is it a steak burrito if a burrito has barely any steak  there apparently isnt a shortage of lettuce though because my burrito was 50 percent lettuce    long story short  this crappy chipotle franchise will no longer get my money  ill go to taquiza or chanos instead for my mex fix,negative
i had never eaten here  before and being that i love teriyaki  i figured id try it  neon  dayglow cauliflower no joke that shit looked like battery acid if i had eaten it i would have glowed in the dark like the infamous radioactive spider damn  may be i shouldve eaten it  nah not worth  the possibility  vomitrocious,negative
the single star is for the impressive beer selection the lack of the other three is for the overdone and overpriced fries and the terrible service  we waited over 25 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink order not even to bring out the food  but just to come get our drink order we had to go find the host to even get a waiter to come by our table and after all that  the food took forever to come out  and the fries were cold and overdone the beer selection is huge  but can be overpriced not worth all the hype and praise would not recommend,negative
it was my first time here went on a friday night with friends after dinner to have some tea and chat because starbucks down the street seems overrated loud too crowded   the atmosphere was nice we looked thru the menu and the prices seemed reasonable i assumed when i ordered a pot 450 versus a mug250 for three of us  it seemed worth it wrong we ordered a pot450 that only came with one cup so i had to get three more cups for my friends  250 each for just empty cups and pay for more water i could have easily just ordered separate drinks   the annoying part was that the worker who took my drinks looked very unhappy and that he hated his job he looked like he didnt want to be there and didnt help me at all i asked him questions but when he answered me  i was still very confused   i dont think i will ever come back,negative
update  i tried them again  just to give them another shot i dined in this time and ordered the same plate of drunken noodle yup  still bad  greasy and gross my friends laughed at me for taking the same risk with the same dish well  jokes on you guys  for eating at the same restaurant with me your dishes werent much better  either suckas  well  at least this time around  i got flat rice noodles,negative
i ordered fordelivery on campusfoodcom  no complaints on this end  the food was quick and delivery was only 1    however  the food left a lot to be desired  i ordered general tsos tofu with fried rice  being vegan  i requested the fried rice to not include egg and they obliged  however  it seems egg is the only thing they put in their fried rice  because i basically got white rice that tasted really  really funky  ive never gone to a chinese food restaurant and had this experience  the general tsos tofu had an incredibly liquidy  noiwontstayonyourbroccoli sauce which in my experience is abnormal  as i have a bit of a general tsos sauce obsession  but the tofu was alright  it just really wasnt very good  at all  i definitely wont be coming back here  certainly not after experiencing the pleasurable dining experience i had at peking garden,negative
i gave this so many stars because their wine was good  was in town visiting friend and she took me here  oh boy ordered the mac and cheese with pork first of all my plate had a hair  disgusting and the taste of the plate was horrible  never again the service was pretty decent though,negative
avoid this place    it is obscenely overpriced  258 for a slice of cheese pizza   everything else is ridiculously overpriced  400 for a small french fries  they keep jacking up the prices  and lowering the quality  they also keep hiring new counter help  who dont understand the concepts of gloves and tongs    just dont bother  if you want cheap  fast pizza during lunch time  go across the street to star market  which has decent pizzabytheslice for lunch during the week  if you want tasty pizza  go down windsor street to the bertuccis on main  if youre looking for something other than cheap pizza  you were at the wrong place to begin with,negative
dear lord  this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to  especially in terms of takingmaking orders correctly and thats really saying something,negative
the only good thing about this place is the selection of 5 footlongs  the people making my sandwich were unfriendly there were no smiles on their faces  and they practically barked at me when they asked for my preferences sandwich making wasnt so hot either the veggies were unevenly spreads out  and the lady cut and wrapped my sandwich without even trying to close the sandwich made eating it so much more difficult than it needed to be  i really wish that i had read these yelp reviews before coming here the 5 spent on this sandwich could have been made for better use at a local restaurant,negative
